iTQNM_QR76psmp-yufufwA,4,"Wooow people, just woow.  This place is delicious, personally its comparable to Pappadeux (if you haven't tried it, then try it).  The menu (i forgot to take a picture of) is obviously a majority of seafood but definitely checkout the pictures taken.  The pictures don't even do the food justice though because its not a scratch n' sniff (or taste).  So, the least you can do is take my word for it. First, lets start with the appetizers.  The appetizers we ordered were fried gator bites and a pile of nachos, for my main course I ordered the creamy linguine with blackened fish (grouper i think.). The gator bites were delish, however I don't recommend using the dipping sauce that it comes with because the seasoning on the gator bites plus the sauce seasoning is almost an instant shot of salt straight to the dome.  Instead I just used good ol' regular ketchup.  The sweetness from the ketchup totally offsets the saltiness on the breading.  I didn't get a chance to really taste the nachos because they were demolished within minutes, but trust me the like of nachos is a literal pile!  Because they got demolished so quick, I'll assume they tasted at least great.  Now for the main course, the creamy linguine with blackened fish was probably one of the best I've had in awhile.  The noodles were a little thicker than what I like, but it didn't take away from the how good it tasted.  The prices for their menu items were a kittle up there, but when you eat here I wanna say you're also paying for an amazing view.  Go around sunset, or stay until then... creates a little better ambiance depending on the party that you come with."
hgF5EO-wKcz8DlSzP1ou7Q,4,"Came to Whiskey Joes for lunch. It has great sitting outside on the patio and inside with wide open windows overlooking the ocean. Amazing views and their portion sizes of food are excellent for sharing! 
I ordered their bowl of Spicy Island Gumbo ($8 & large size) and it tasted good and could be a meal if you were looking for a little bit lighter lunch portion. Also ordered the Snapper in Paradise which was at least a 6oz piece of fish topped with tomatoes and sauce that was delicious. It came with two sides and I ordered the broccoli and fries. ($26) Wasn't too fond of the broccoli, needed seasoned and was half way raw. It is slightly higher in price, but know that their portions make up for it and the sizes are worth the price. 
Only other thing that I didn't know is that there is valet parking only in their lot which is $5. 
I didn't get to go on the beach area because it was windy and slightly raining, but looks great and relaxing! Will be back to sit out and relax in the sun!"
lgdwDAfS_P9M-yg0MvmJTg,1,"I want to start saying that I wish I could give no stars. This place is hands down the worst food in all Tampa Bay area. If you want to grab a drink and look at the water, it might be ok.. if you wish to eat something descent (not looking for gourmet food here), please go to Bahama Breeze on the other side of the bay (5 min from this place). My experience started with the hostess being mean to us saying that I would have to wait 1 hour at least to sit outside on a Tuesday afternoon. Ok, we asked to sit inside by the window and even though the tables were empty, including several window ones, they said that it wasn't possible. 

Anyway, we ordered the peel n' shrimp for app and it was okay. Then, we ordered a chopped salad, scallops app and jambalaya. They were all nasty and it felt like they were sitting in the kitchen and then they just brought up to our table. The prices are also not cheap for a bar with mediocre food.

I understand you're on the water and people like coming here for drinks and ""party"", but please serve food that at least taste fine. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone and will not for sure bring friends that visit from out of town ever again."
lfDtvjhnriu3yWBLg1yGSA,1,"Would not recommend as a place for a large group. I had a group of 20 on a Sunday evening, and even though reservation was made more than a week before, service was horrible. Had to hunt down a waitress to take orders from us one hour after the reservation time, and then beg to get our checks at the end. Waitresses stopped by not even once in 3 hours to check up on us. I tipped how much I thought the servers worked for (actually, I thought I was being generous with what I tipped given how little they did), only to face a waitress confronting me at the end with the elusive ""was everything okay? because we live on tips"". LOL. COME ON. I had asked for tables conducive for socializing and even though there were tables in a corner area perfect for the purpose, I was instead given a looong linear table in the middle of the restaurant. Given the perfect location and views they have going on for them, I think they would do sooo much better if they hired the right people to attend on clients. *end of vent*"
jNBViPHOt35KY74tXxrPjA,2,Service is slow. No one approched us and when i grabed a waitress it took forever to get a pitcher of beer.
RLjBFzzBtcHzC6x5YW52QA,3,"We take visitors here when we pick them up at the airport. Nachos are the best. The food is great and the outside seating by the water is pleasant.  I wish they would have a larger menu for beach side, but, you can always eat inside and just hang outside with yummy drinks"
zm0pSrJwv_98A0UY9TGnMA,3,Would be a 4 to 5 star if the wait wasn't as long for the food.  Tastes great. Fun staff amazing view.
JBTTC2P0Kx-uuNo5c4WAtQ,3,"Traveled down to Whiskey Joe's with my wife for lunch. We ordered their Tequila and Garlic dip pen shrimp, and that appetizer had great flavor. We then order the Gumbo for me and the Beer Cheese soup for her. My gumbo had a good flavor but a little runny. Her Beer Cheese had a great flavor but very thin like water. Then I order their Fish and Chips and my wife ordered the Ma hi Fish Tacos. Both dishes look good but... very plain flavor, nothing outstanding about food. The service was top topnotch as well as the view...."
xPZl8X4M8-6_EHu0LFWURQ,2,"I need to make clear the beach bar and the restaurant are two very different experiences. I'll start with the restaurant, the lobby smelled like URINE. Overwhelmingly. The girls bathrooms were lovely, but the boys said the smell definitely was coming from their restroom, and it was repulsive. If I could, negative stars. The only thing safe to order would be bottled beer. And the price would be worth it given the great view. I was in a group of 8 people. Not one rated their food over a 3/10. And we're not hard to please people.
Oysters- The worst oysters hands down. Absolutely zero taste. I ordered 6, ate 2. Wish I'd had none. Nachos- I couldn't even find the cheese until I gave up on eating it and just dug with a fork to find it on the VERY BOTTOM along with some very soggy chips.
Chipotle Cioppino- was sent back. But they didn't charge her. Although I was still charged for my oysters.
Swashbuckler's Basket- 2 orders of this. Probably the most well received of the lot. But still rated a 3/10.
All American Sliders- was requested to come with avocado, not only missing the avocado but also the onions. Was later brought out on the side. My friend ended up eating the patties by themselves just to get the protein because she needed to eat something.
Signature Burger- She said the burger had 0 flavor. Ate the fries which she considered mediocre.
Gumbo- probably the best thing I tasted but crazy salty. Something I have no problem with my friend was not a fan.
The drinks- 2 margaritas and I had some type of lemonade. You will never get drunk here. Both girls that ordered the margaritas ordered a second shot to pour in... By the time I was halfway done with my drink, halfway, it was just water. Not even syrup.
The service- Nah. Wasn't there. The waiter seemed to put in some effort but he was clearly not having a good year. The lack of effort was made very evident though when about 15 or more seagulls attacked a nearby table that hadn't been cleaned off. I swear I'm not making any of this up. This was our experience.

That bar tho...

While still spendy, they were well worth it. Sitting on the beach with that view! And my drink was so unbelievably yummy. I crave it days later. I believe it was The Hurricane Juice that I ordered. It was blended, blue and had coconut milk. It was unbelievable. If you're nearby, and want a tasty drink, game of volleyball, a swim, or corn hole, definitely stop here. Just stay as far away from the main restaurant as possible."
SOT0THlT7xDq-7haI6Ss8Q,3,"Great beach, nice staff. Food and drink is expensive and not very good. Parking is also an issue."
wSGHQk1J64cF3Fkdtj50Ow,1,"Greasy tasteless expensive food. Don't buy into the hype and save your money. We ordered fried grouper sandwich, blackened grouper dinner and jerk chicken sandwich. No flavor except grease."
wxpywz7AMfBwJ-bDY8FqQA,5,Bar on the beach is amazing! Jamaican jerk chicken sandwich was delicious! Drink specials were fruity and sweet. The atmosphere is definitely what makes it!
IUBNQXEakOOMEk21XyD1JQ,4,"You simply cannot beat the views from every seat in this place!  Pull up an outdoor bar stool, watch the sunset and order a frozen margarita or daiquiri with your honey.  Stroll over to the beach or their tiki bar in the sand.

The food is better than average although not gourmet..... fish tacos, beer can chicken, a nice beer cheese bread bowl soup.  

Tequila is great but with the views, music and people at this hopping place it is best to come early and stay all day.  

Be sure to valet park for free but tip those guys - parking is tight here.  Love their little gift shop and space for large parties.  Lots of live music indoors and out - only thing missing is a Sunday brunch- especially with those views..... this used to be called castaways years ago and they were known for their brunch... something to think about Joes..... a great place to bring visiting frineds from out of town for enough space, good food and frozen concoctions!"
DvpfdJDuKFfWnV6occEwQw,4,"Very good Gator bites, and fish tacos. Great location looking over the bay. It was a very good, comfortable environment. Would totally go again next time I'm in Tampa, FL."
nYU3yO-D5OiJG9VvvD-vmg,4,"First time here. Fun of good view of the place. View is very relaxing by the beach, good weather. The only thing is the horrible parking as its always  packed and you have to pay if you park  by the beach. Would  definitely  come back if given a chance."
Tis5ECH2Y2NecuJSEM-a2Q,2,This is such a nice place the location is awesome the set up is super chill however i came to the outside tiki bar to grab lunch ordered the sliders very well done they came out pink so i bit one and returned them because i do not do pink meat. Then again i re ordered them saying please very welll done like cripsy . The girls put in a new order they came out once again cooked the same temperature PINK! I dont know how u can mix up WELL DONE AND RARE!!!! Two very different things. First time here and id only come back to drink and chill....
BOTuVpBkuMoPtS6UbS-BWA,3,"I have been to this establishment several times. The food is decent and the environment is very fun. I would try the scallops with the mango sauce! The prices are a little high, but I guess that's expected right on the water. When the beach is busy it is almost impossible to get a drink on time and the staff is not very friendly. Fun place to visit with a large party, but as for an every day restaurant.... I would not recommend."
OGsFMAj6gJ1w0n5Gqdm4Yg,4,The Coconut Mojito was amazeballs. The food was just pretty good.
JdqyvFButEKgGDlQqyjR1w,3,"Food is just okay, but the location is AMAZING. 

There is a barefoot bar on the beach with sand everywhere. It's right on the water. There's also cozy fireplaces to sit around! Great location."
IOHETizZaE64eSrplLVrHA,1,"Uhhh...tourist trap? Starts on a Sunday with no where to park but valet....sorry not validated.....parking. 45 minute wait for table. Seated and waited about 10-15 minutes before some waitress asked if anyone had served us.....seriously? Ordered the taco salad. The meat was clumped as though packed in a can before dumping onto the salad. The garlic bread was tasty, but a bit stale. When this place says"" family friendly"", they aren't joking. Felt like I was at McDonald's play land. Kids everywhere playing let's have a foot race, and commando raid, while absorbed unconcerned parents confused this place with the park playground. The icing on the cake? Family of 4 whose immigration status is highly suspect. Two little girls who scream like banshees, as loud as possible, at the slightest want gone unsatisfied. Obviously they need special help. Meanwhile the grunting fat father does not even bat an eye at the commotion, and only gets involved when one of them runs towards the bar.
On Sundays this place is LOUD. Add to that the playground for children, the valet cost, the WAY overpriced tourist quality grub, gets no stars (I wish) and no returns. I urge others to find another scenic restaurant."
T5lqrkLj6Ss2WOIB9NY5YA,3,"When we arrived, only option was valet..$5, then we wanted to enjoy outside feet in the sand for a couple drinks and food, went to go out to the tiki where we were stopped for another $5 per person cover charge for the DJ..So $15 before we have The opportunity to give them more $$..we opted to eat inside, must say food was great, our server James was awesome, however won't be back..too many options in our great area where they don't hit you up for money before you get in the door."
08viOztiNYpZ-S4MfusKJw,1,"We were very disappointed with this place, it took 20 minutes for the kids drinks,45 minutes for chips/salsa appetizer to come out!! And it took almost an hour for the food to come out, then it was cold.We didn't complain, service was Horrible we will NOT be com"
Vv6DeH4WvBz-c8gxvdD-yw,5,"Where do I begin. Well after long nights yelping and researching for a good spot for my daddys 51st birthday I came across good ol Whiskey Joes. At first my dad didn't even want to go out but after a few coronas  and getting him all spiffy like as real live goodfella he was ready for a good time and that he had. We started off with frozen Jose Cuervo margaritas and him and my mom with a side shot and our appetizers. It was a party of 16 but just to name a few we had there cheese garlic bread which wasn't to grand, there shrimp scampi that my sister devoured, the wings were deeeeelish and so was the kalamari (so my family said because I don't eat no seafood). Oh and might I ask there mud slides were GREAT. The plates of food were gargantuan but all around the food was good. They had the Ketel One girls there giving our free shots and taking pics with mi papa and he was in heaven. Our waitress was slacking because she could handle such a big party plus three other tables. That was the only down fall I believe with parties of eight or more you should get your own waitress for the night. 

 After all the good times at the table we went to the dance floor to tear it up. There were some crazy characters on the dance floor but that made it all the while fun. I hated the peanuts people got to eat because they were EVERYWHERE! NOT GOOD JUST A MESS. There was even one guy using them as confetti. The dj Short-E was pretty good he had us on the dance floor all night and having my dad like the king of the joint. He shouted out my dad the whole night and got him even more free shots from the vip table. It was the best time I had in a while so if your looking for a family outing but with a jamming good time after, Whiskey Joes is a 20 in my book!!"
GB1OfqRLt9cGHV1_puEOyA,5,"I came here for lunch on a Saturday. The place was packed. Must be over 500 people here. I ordered the Black Bleau Hamburger. It was very good. 

I would recommend it to anyone. I would also recommend my server Sara. She came over to the table several times to check on me and to answer any questions I may have. I will return here in the future and I will ask for her."
3h1O8PpJqblAOpaTNyI0bQ,1,This place is Satan's tourist trap. The food is worse than cat food. The service was a special kind of terrible. It has a great view of the bay though which you get to see such classy things as a woman going to take a piss. Save yourself and stomach and skip this hell hole.
mqtxeafUc3RUlRg3ukUC3w,4,"This would be a full 5 if the prices were just a little bit more reasonable! I also never get my favorite drinks made the same way twice which makes me feel nervous each time I order 

The atmosphere and location is one of a kind and it keeps me returning!"
HaLnMd7MOMkQI8bnqppOYA,3,"Great sunset view, but the food's not bad either.  A past visit left us underwhelmed, but this time we truly enjoyed our meal.  Fresh oysters, a delicious grouper sandwich and a chipotle pasta prepared just as requested.   It's not fine cuisine, but it's not intended to be such.  Relax, drink, eat and enjoy the view."
8V8tPzhkGK6yecuzlThkNA,5,"Been here several times and always good.  Tonight my wife and I took my parents for their first time and had great food and a fantastic server, Margaret E.(Maggie) I believe was her name.  Very sweet and excellent service.  She worked hard and made sure we had everything we needed and drinks were always full.  On the way out she even High Fived my 80 year old dad, that made his day.  Thank you Maggie!"
3_NL9FiRps6Q0ocPfaW9OQ,3,Went here for dinner on a Monday night while on a business trip. Nice atmosphere and our waitress was pleasant. Self parking options are limited unless your willing to circle the lot until someone leaves. Toll beach parking is close or valet.
sYc6FPcZtkwF1rZFUr0ryQ,4,"Great sunsets from the out door bar! .... but 
food is average at best especially for the prices as your def paying for waterfront atmosphere . Will go back next time in town ..."
SAVL1kvlTtSYYpBwBPzOQg,3,"Went in for lunch around 2 & I ordered a burger, my friend got a grouper sandwhich. Food was very bland. About as much as I'd expect from a beach restaurant. The drinks were most likely made from syrups, not fresh fruits. I ordered a wild berry mojito that was supposed to have fresh berries on top or muddled in (not sure) but it had a cherry on top (The kind that stay preserved in jars for years and years to come). 
 Servers didn't seem to care, but ours did a good job so that was fine. 
We had to take the handicap ramp out because I had a stroller, servers sleeping in back room on the way out. Friendly chef on the outside of door, but he was smoking - So all in all 3 stars. Not bad, not great."
Vj_PtHManwz2sMmAKeg96g,4,"This place was great. Great views over the water from almost everywhere in the restaurant. I ordered the Maui tacos and they were delicious. Another person in my group order the fish and they stated it was amazing. The service was great and the staff was extremely friendly. I did pay with a credit card and they do not have a machine, so they had to make a carbon copy (old school paper way). I was shocked with that, but food was great and I would come back here to have some drinks and enjoy the view of the water."
F04DzjRFlSQObFX8dHT6dg,4,4.5 stars really! This is a great place to eat and drink on Tampa Bay. Sitting on the deck with a cool breeze and a stiff drink this becomes one of the places where you forget your worries for a few!They may just have one of the best locations on Tampa Bay for the view and with the out side deck and all the giant windows weather you are outside enjoying the breeze or inside to beat the heat you have great views of the water. The food is good but I feel the menu is a little limited which is why I gave 4.5 instead of 5. A little pricey but not too bad.
I0a6enrOCFR0slingUCL5g,2,"I decided to try this place with some friends and we came out disappointed. The calamari and fried alligator came out soggy instead of hot and crunchy. There wasn't much flavor to the appetizers. 

We shared 3 entrees: gumbo, jambalaya, and seafood mac&cheese. The gumbo lacked in the seafood flavor. The jambalaya was average. The seafood mac&cheese was a disappointment. For $20, I expected for different types of shellfish in my mac&cheese. However, all I got was a plate of mac&cheese with tiny bits of shrimp mixed inside.

The service was okay but a tad bit slow. Our waitress checked on us once but never refilled our waters until we had to flag her down & ask for a refill.

The one thing that was enjoyable was the view of the ocean we had at our table."
sZuIQFwdhglj8CDPV8kHlg,2,"Great view, location. Food was mediocre at best. Ordered signature tequila garlic shrimp appetizer- it was not very good....tiny and very few shrimp. The grouper entree came out cold and was small for the price. Net not a repeat for a meal, but a drink at sunset is a maybe."
GeuYaVG5qmmJLu6pOe59PQ,2,"OK place.....views are GREAT......service not so much.  Bartenders need lots of help in acknowledging those at the bar.....let alone the dinner table orders from their waitstaff!  One blonde behind the bar was rude, in the way of other bar staff, and slow.  Should be fired, or at least relegated to the kitchen.  Can't work in a busy environment.  Sad.....could be a Great place!!"
JMNJpYg45SFsxK1SELOWtw,4,"Ok so this has become one of my favorite spots in town the garlic par wings are too die for, they have a really great vibe both inside and outside at the beach bar their loaded sweet potato fries are  awesome all around great time the service could use a lil improvement out at the beach bar ."
9XK2OjpDEa__A-JE3g1hpg,5,So me and my fiancÃ© chose to come here because it was on the water. We brought the baby with us. I had read other Yelp reviews and they weren't that positive. But we gave it a try anyways. Upon getting there we weren't even greeted by a server once sat. But our server JAMIE made up for it all. She was first class and made sure we had everything we needed. Constantly checked back and took it to another level. I highly recommend her and any of her sections. She knows what it means to give good service. It's servers like this who make up for others mistakes. She made me and my family's experience memorable and us want to come back again. Great queso dip and pretty decent food. A must for anyone who wants to be by the ocean and enjoy some food and drinks!
bHQLbkSRfazwOpT4ivThTQ,2,I was not happy at all. I'm a foodie so I'll give anything a try. I should have know to turn away based off the other reviews. I'm in town for the weekend and my hotel is next door. I went to whisky joes and was served soggy fried fish. Not only was my fish was soggy but so was my friends. We order the Jamaican White fish. The batter wasn't cooked all the way.  Our server was polite. I can't fault him for the cooks action but for that they are getting 2 stars.
RtKZI1AY5GCXibiJDU3gpw,2,"Parking is non existent and painful to maneuver after rejection - the lot is so ill conceived that we sat in a line of vehicles just trying to leave. Once in, the band plays outside (brilliant in Florida summer weather) and the service was ridiculously bad. When someone DID finally stop to take our order, they had attitude. Finally went to the bar when I wanted a water refill...the water is self serve out of a bar top machine. Except..it was empty! And no one behind the bar cared once we got their attention. The food was horrible. I ordered what I thought was shrimp and it came out in a bowl. It looked like shrimp soup. I was told ""oh, it's a dipping sauce"" what? Ick. My husbands burger was dry...and he couldn't get service at the bar either. When I asked for a to-go box, the server sighed mightily and told me she'd have to go inside for that. 15 mins later, I saw her trudging up the walkway for said box. Needless to say, I will never go there again and my shrimp soup ended up in the garbage. Even the dog didn't want it."
Bg5GkpAntCU9xMqlgmpjig,2,"It was very astounding situation at the front desk that we stepped in and they just looked at us without saying 'Hi'. The hostess looked at my face and stayed quiet for seconds. I couldn't stand being awkward,therefore, I started saying Hi to her.. No response once again.. So I said We are a party of four, now yes, 'follow me..'. 

Food was literally mediocre. Just a seafood restaurant by the beach. Table service was just slightly different from the hostess. Only thing we're impressed is the atmosphere by the beach.

Sad to say Being respectful should be the basis for the good human being. Hopefully, you just forgot NOT be on purpose. Otherwise,  :-("
E25FVF87m1wxTrSoKEf_Mg,4,"Whiskey Joe's has great views of the Bay and is only a couple of minutes from the airport.  Its very popular with my coworkers for happy hour, but tourists will also enjoy the relaxed atmosphere and views.  The food is fairly good. I'm a fan of their nachos, fried calamari (that includes breaded and fried green and red peppers) and the cocount shrimp.  

Whiskey Joe's is located right on the Causeway and the drive over the Causeway is one of my favorite. I highly recommend this place for locals and tourists alike."
O-kjEMoTsdVISmvSBJWhGQ,4,"Parking is rough but they have valet which makes it easier.  It's crazy busy on the weekends.  My favorite time was a random Monday afternoon and just sitting outside for a bit with the water made my day.  The drinks aren't anything special, but hey the ambience is quite nice when it's not crowded. It makes me feel like I'm on vacation! Water, warm sand, and tiki huts is all I need!"
gEuJjhv1CcD3i4Nk70Hb-A,1,"Bathroom filthy, I wonder what the kitchen looks like? Our group had steak tacos-bad, Mac & cheese w crab & shrimp, couldn't eat it, waitress told us ""don't order that"" we should have listened! Burgers over cooked. For 7 meals no drinks paid $160. Not incl. Tip"
RwIgGdve4XEGo6iIfcC7IA,4,Good bar food!! Great location with outdoor seating and water views! Pricing is great too for the amount of food you get!
AHDUWm0-5zWDH9Ko1HngCw,4,"the wait staff is friendly and efficient. I ordered mussels that had the best taste, but half weren't opened, the waitress immediately took them back and placed a second order, there was only one closed and I didn't mind because the sauce they are in is fantastic. I ordered the steak tacos and they were pretty bland, even with all the toppings on it....it was a bit pricey at $11.99 for two soft shell tacos....my bill was $31 for mussels, two tacos and a $5 beer....but it was my date night with myself"
VbtuSjPLcc_Attfu9-knVQ,5,An absolute gem in Tampa. Premiere piece of real estate. Stunning views and the area on the sand is great. We had the mahi mahi bites. They were delicious. I wish it was a little warmer when we went. Defenetly would be back. Service was friendly and fast.
JZlBbHnatlH_WK3R6GjlAA,5,"Love it. Me and my friend went there for lunch. We got a very nice seat outside right next to the water. There were a lot of food. I could only finish one taco and take the other home. Staffs are super friendly. Thank you to our server, Tiffany. However, I don't like they only have valet parking."
TzEFkNUFU_sqUZTvbv_goQ,5,The food is AMAZING !!!!!!! If you want fresh and i mean fresh sea food then this is the place that you need to come.
rzkTBOduKTSdmR63Aa-xew,1,Dirty... And just needs a total makeover.. service was horrible... Bartenders were rude and had no customer service skills..
1mH7lzLe8GreZF5D8A87Kg,3,"I came here this past summer with a local friend while working in Tampa for the week. The location is great - we had a table with a view of the water and then ventured to the outdoor tiki bar after dinner. The service was good, nothing over the top but good. The food was the same - good, no complaints. I had the coconut shrimp as an app and then the shrimp and crab louie salad for my dinner. The salad was loaded with ingredients that all went well together. I would come back here again if I were in Tampa. Nothing stood out besides the location, but nothing was bad either."
aOKNcA6PxsRaGYKO21h3og,2,"First time here, I arrived before the rest of my party. I decided to grab a seat at the inside bar while I waited. My first impression is that this place is not cleaned properly.  I chose a seat near the beer taps. There were fruit flies all over the place- all over the tap drains, the alcohol bottles,my personal space. The bar was sticky and you could smell the stale alcohol. Not up to my standards of cleanliness."
ry1ViN57pCGIVdTAVi3a0g,3,"On a Saturday evening this is a busy place with limited parking and average food. You can pay $5 for valet parking or leave your car in the beach park next door.  On entering for dinner, the bar is crowded and the restaurant is noisy. For appetizers the onion rings were good; the steamed mussels were average (the cooks left 4 unopened ones in the serving, instead of just placing opened ones in the serving dish). The scallop salad was ok. The macaroni and cheese was creamy & had a cheesy flavor but was bland/boring.  The fish sandwich was not very tasty and came on a large sesame-seed hamburger bun that was not toasted. Drinks did not seem to have much booze. The margaritas on the rocks were half ice cubes.  The staff were friendly and the food came to the table in a short time.  We felt the drink prices were too high and the chef should pay attention to making the food more flavorful.  On the positive side-there was a parrot head event outside at the restaurant."
G6_9UuxXkVcWppdfHRcH6w,2,"This would have to be one of the most disappointing lunches. I read reviews and thought it sounded good so headed over before flying out. Food was not good, pizza tasted like a frozen pizza, blackened grouper tacos tasted undercooked and really no flavor, not sure what happened to the blackened fish. I would save my money next time and skip this place. Nothing about it impressed me. Too many other great spots in and around Tampa area. Sorry!"
mTOCi39L_szcVidhs9EBQg,3,"The food is just okay here...nothing to really write about.  The scallops were over cooked and the raw oysters were borderline (I should have known it to order it because it's not in season but being spoiled in Boston I thought it would be okay to order...thank God I didn't get sick.  

The view is absolutely beautiful.  The ambiance and bar is good too."
UygApAl4-3Jm6Qj2rCfCEw,5,"Marty the GM was gracious enough to contact me, and explain that the parking problem we experienced was a SNAFU caused by a county employee, and that it will never happen again.  He also sent a very nice letter of apology to our friends who were with us, celebrating a birthday.  And, he sent us gift certificates for our next dinner.

My wife and I regularly dine out.   Most restaurants don't respond to bad reviews because they don't care.  Whiskey Joe's does care about their patrons and their reputation, and made things right by us, and our friends.


Hats off!  We will be back."
mwf7kKwGL0WvUeG0M9CsWA,5,"Typical on waterfront  bar, huge place with outdoor seating and ALOT of indoor seating.. Oddly great service, didn't expect the attentiveness we got.. Great place next to ben t davis beach.. Mixed crowd with older folks, tourists and ""locals"".."
AwVB_CveBk905qAgT3ojyA,3,"Solid 3.5.. Place was packed & right on the beach. Sat on the deck looking over the bay. 

Blackened Grouper sandwich was excellent but the fries were just ok. Probably frozen and refried. 

Staff was awesome.. Very friendly and attentive..
Loved the beach motif and the atmosphere .."
bNDYtQ9JDSScXv-bbq6d_g,1,"Bring Your Own Fish

Stopped in for some ""Famous FishTacos""  after we picked my mom up from TPA for quick lunch and was super disported .  We all ordered the 3 fish tacos $15  which had very little to almost NO fish in them and little flavor.
My poor mom got the least and I felt bad as I was the one who picked the place!  The only bright spot in the whole experience was our server who was great. SKIP THIS PLACE"
RwD5I8eyMyr8s6drOWm_dg,5,"Can't beat the view or key lime pie!  Ask for Frank, he was a fantastic server.  As it was my first time he guided me through the menu and had excellent spot on recommendations.  Impeccable service.  Get a table on deck, can't get much more relaxed then this!"
#NAME?,3,Its on the water.  The food was ok and the staff was ok.  There wasn't anything that stuck out and would bring me back again.  I didn't think the waiter was concerned with our table at all.  Our drinks didn't get filled our whole meal.  Scenery is nice. Meeeeh. Ok.
otgJoma_5G5w2W_7cIcHnw,3,"Came to Whiskey Joe's on a Tuesday night for dinner with some work colleagues.  The view out on to the water is incredible, the decor within the restaurant is nice, and the service was very good.  The bar looked like a good place to hang out as well for drinks if you weren't in for dinner.  We started with the spinach, artichoke, and crab dip, then I had the fish tacos (baja-style) for dinner.  The dip was served with chips and was good.  The fish tacos were also pretty tasty, though not what I would call true baja-style, it's probably more accurate to describe it as ""baja-style-like.""  There was a decent beer and tropical drink list as well.  All in all, I would definitely give this place a solid 3 to 3.5 stars...a good place for dinner and drinks with an awesome view."
z_68kPydR1ZdSnRbfRsamw,4,"If you are from out of town and visiting Tampa, this would probably be the perfect place to stop by for drinks on the beach. It is convenient and not too far from hotels and has a parking lot. There is live music or a dj, an outside bar and fire pits. The beach-y vibes are definitely at a full 100 here. If you go for dinner or later, the sunset and views are pretty nice.

I was here on a work trip with about 30 people so we went outside to the beach area where there were tons of open tables. There are waitresses who will come to the tables and take your orders but there is also a bar where you can just go up and order your food and drinks. They were not staffed very well for tons of orders on the beach the night we came but our waitress was very fast and friendly. I would definitely give her props for how many orders she had to take and deliver.

The drinks here are pretty sweet. I would not recommend any of the margaritas or mixed drinks from the menu if you do not like sweet drinks. They are border line too sweet and will probably make you sick if you have too many. With that being said, they tasted good and you could definitely tell they had alcohol in them.

We ordered many appetizers and a few entrees. The food is not high quality but it does the job. I would say casual family dinner / bar food quality. If you want to try alligator they have gator bites which are fried and taste like chicken."
C-PSqBHuPlvCLXWkMovnuw,2,"I was less than impressed here tonight. The ambience and scenery is great. The food is mediocre at best, and the service wasn't my favorite. 

I ordered the grilled mahi with shrimp bertie. I have a gluten allergy and let the waitress know. I cannot eat grains currently (medical issue), and requested a side of collard greens instead of the jasmine rice. The waitress seemed very uncomfortable with this request even though I stated I was ok with paying the full amount for the additional side since they don't do substitutions. This didn't seem to sit well with her, so I just accepted her offer of double veggies because I didn't feel like arguing about it. 

A few minutes later, the waitress told me the sauce would be on the side since it has gluten in it. I would expect that in 2014 - in an area like Tampa - servers and chefs would be cognizant enough of the fact that putting a sauce on the side on my dish that contains an ingredient I'm allergic to is a ridiculous idea. Why would I want a sauce that is going to make me sick for 2 weeks to be brought out with my mealâ€½ I politely requested the sauce be left out altogether. 

The mahi was dry and overcooked. The shrimp on top were small and unimpressive. For $20.99, there should've been Gulf shrimp on this dish, not the tiny shrimp they serve at Panera. 

It's too bad because the venue looks great. But the servers need to be educated, and the food could use a serious upgrade. 

Sit on the deck and enjoy a couple of drinks. Eat elsewhere."
Fkgvr9O48yfhQLbp6m9V6Q,1,"Whiskey Joes is TERRIBLE! place smells like everyone and everything pissed all over everything. Even mentioned it to the hostess. They say it always does and people quit their job there because of the filth. Food was some of the worst served in a restaurant. Mcdonalds puts this place to shame. Service is a joke. I will tell everyone how horrible this place is.. Way over priced.. Warm beer, bread served half warm/half cold. All Sysco crap food.. Place sucks!"
5dNj1KhZQOZwhl7MP9liyA,4,"So, check it out, from outside, I thought, typical tourist chain - when I got inside, that was exactly what it was.
But, great points: not-so-typical-fare like gator cakes, and gator bites. Great seafood gumbo, and the service was on point.
Live reggae music on Sunday night and a gift shop for t shirts and hats and such.
Honestly, the bartender rocked and the food was good. The mussels were good enough for me to eat all of them and not regret one morsel.
It's a fun place if you happen to be in Tampa and have nothing else to do."
2BwjXw50Ad2BzGanNk3V5A,4,"We've been wanting to go to this place for a few weeks. We're very new to the area and decided to try it out the other day. It was pretty slammed there. They actually have valet parking. I'm not sure, but making a reservation is possible. We started off at the bar, but ended up moving outside. We ordered the whiskey pepper dippin shrimp (I had them put the gross feta on the side) and it was by far the most delicious shrimp dish I've had...maybe ever! 
My fella ordered the grouper with rice, broccoli, and got a GIANT Cobb salad (he had them bring out the salad first). The salad was amazing (juicy grilled chicken, bacon, mangos, and more) and could be an actual entree (without blue cheese, please). I got the fish (pollock) and chips. The seasoning on the fries was yummy and the fish was well-flavored. I will say we probably won't order all this food next time. We were wicked full after inhaling the app and salad. We had some full to-go boxes. Even though it was very busy, our service was solid and waitress was efficient. We'll go back again and try other stuff :)"
SJ_UGwv5UY825TWjV19Qbg,2,"We tried to order food from one of the tables in the sand (beach area), but the waitress did not return. So after waiting around an hour we decided to head up to the deck area.  The view from the deck was totally awesome!  Wait staff was friendly enough. 

Food was average, but I'd go again to relax and enjoy the view!"
5gJ8goa6K9gayG6zyYb2Zg,5,"Location, location, location (and wonderful menu and outstanding service).  I visited Whiskey Joe's to meet 2 local attorneys when first arriving to Tampa.  Close to the airport, but you are immediately on the water and white beach sand.  Calamari and other appetizers were outstanding.  Staff very friendly. There is an outdoor beach bar setting on the sand as wells as restaurant/ patio seating.  This is the experience I was looking for from a Florida restaurant!  We spent 4 more days in the general area... Whiskey Joe's was the best!"
5AOeK-bch7Xj43Vl_ky0UA,5,We come down to Whiskey Joe's every year for Music on The Bay. For the last 2 years we have nothing but amazing service outside from Amanda P. The best server you have!! She never gets an order wrong and always has a smile on her face. Attentive and a wonderful person!! This year we also had the pleasure to have Felicia as our server one evening. Wonderful as well!! We will see them again next year if not before!!
QV2W3YVokEVFT8JyQFrLKg,5,"This place is like a mini vacation.  My work is by here, so some of my co-workers and I decided to get together for Happy Hour on Friday and relax on Whiskey Joe's beach.  Great idea!  They have great Happy Hour specials, an awesome view, really good service (even on the beach), and great food!  Their Joe's Nachos and chilled peel and eat shrimp apps were so good, and HUGE. Our server was very nice, attentive and patient even though she was clearly very busy.  

Will definitely be going back here a lot more!"
xGEPyay_F2H2ZAhIgi_uig,2,"Great view. But mediocre food and experience. Our server was nice, but food came out cold, was super expensive for quality that well, was not that great. I mean I ordered chips and queso as an appetizer and the cheese and chips were cold. It's more of a place to pull up with your boat and drink. Or go and enjoy the outside beach and patio and have a couple adult beverages than actually enjoying a meal. Oh, and parking is a disaster, the valet lets in people in the lot at his random discretion. No method to the madness."
KTxhi3JCeDSjfnv3GseOkw,3,"Great location! Good Drinks! Good Food! Maybe we were there on a bad waitstaff day, cuz that's rhe only reason why I can't give 5 starts.  The waitress 
/waiters can make or break the visit."
2U9ZNzZbqaCa5eYeL89LDQ,2,"Terrible place. Dirty and trashy. Poor service and I would go if you're looking to eat. That said, if you want to get drunk around a bunch of trashy other drunks. Come on in"
zlhrAJgBXXJWvhRphxIiMg,1,"Seriously dissapointed.
We were trying to show our friends from out of town a good time by enjoying the sunset on the water. Our first attempt there will be our last. Valet sign said parking lot was full we were directed to only find parking on the beach. We waited a few minutes and numerous parties left, allowing spots to free up. But were still told to find spots on the beach, half of our party waited out front while the other half drove around to find parking. In doing so, valet took the next 3 cars immediately. After seeing that we directed our car to come back and took our large party else where. Extremely dissapointing and bad customer service overall."
kZaeCydgzR8JDc6nHhricA,1,"I went to Whiskey Joe's For a meet up event on April 28th... we arrived early for dinner at 18:45. There was a ""band"" playing at 21:00 so we arrived early enough for dinner so as not to have to pay a cover charge to eat. As ridiculous as it sounds even at 18:45 they were insisting on a $10 per person cover charge. If we had not been meeting others later we would have left. The evening began on a sour note with the cover charge... and continued with mediocre food and poor service by the very slow moving waitstaff. 
     The ""band"" that ""played"" was singularly bad. I high school pick up band would have played better since they actually play their own instruments. This band for all intents and purpose looked to be mailing it in and lip syncing. Clearly not worth any cover charge let alone the $10 per person they charged.
Yes, I realize that I was already biased by the cover charge but poor service is poor service. I will never patronize this place again despite it's wonderful location."
2Rg1lyBo9mVSmMjHUop3WQ,4,"Stopped by Sunday January 21.  Hubby recommended after finding accidentally on a trip to Tampa several months ago.  While the parking lot, the tiki bar, the outside deck and the inside bar were packed and lively, we enjoyed a more relaxed, quiet spot in the dining room.  Sat at window overlooking the Bay watching our Jacksonville Jaguars (sadly) lose to New England as the sun set in all its glory.  We started with Gator Bites - best use for any gator.  Tasty.  Hubby ordered Shrimp and Grits.  He says they were some of the best he's ever had.  Seasoned very well with nine large shrimp.  I ordered the Snapper grilled substituting cheesy grits for the rice.  Snapper was moist and also nicely seasoned.  Came with two beans and carrots as the veg.  Yummy all around.  Rounded dinner out with two Whisky Joe's beers (a red snd a blond) which we liked a lot too.  Sum up:  Hubby was right to recommend.  Atmosphere choices for everyone.  Stay off the deck if you want a quieter dinner.  Bring yiyr bathing suit to eat, drink and play on the sand at the tiki bar.  Bring $5 cash for valet parking - worth it.  Nice employees too."
KGnFVSUPYax5o-HxiLNvzA,4,"Great food with an awesome atmosphere. The service left something to be desired, and they let some lady in to sell candles for charity, which is very weird. You really don't want to be pressured into buying a candle for someone with cancer at dinner. All things considered, a decent place to visit but with so many other choices, I would probably check out some other place on my next trip."
Z-H_7f-28Drm49Flmxyrsw,5,"Today was my long awaited college graduation. go Bulls! I reserved space at Whiskey Joes for our celebration. This place has never let me down!! Joanne, the manager, was so accommodating to us. The food is wonderful and wait staff are very attentive- even though we were a party of 20+ with all separate checks! You're missing out if you haven't been!"
ueWrn0jGC98hyoB3laBY1A,1,"The only redeeming quality of this establishment is its location, do not eat here. The odor when you walk in is overwhelming and should have been my cue to leave but I had friends in town that wanted to be on the water...The service is good, aside from the significant overuse of ""ya'll "". Food: fish tacos, I ""upgraded"" to grouper (something I don't really understand, just have grouper on your menu) I spit it out in my napkin...  I haven't done that since I was a child!!! I don't know what that was but it wasn't grouper!  I apologize for graphic visual but the food here is not good."
7XYd04zxFmrGxfFhX_ylKA,3,I was here for a Trop Rock fundraiser and ate inside the restaurant. They weren't very busy inside but the service was very slow. It took forever to get our drinks. I had the beer battered grouper sandwich and my boyfriend had the shrimp tacos. The food was pretty good and the servings were large.
fJYOLgkujw5LxeeUgwkEow,5,"This place is wonderful! Excellent service. The hostesses were nice and our server was attentive. We got the fish tacos and hamburger sliders - both were great. 

THE VIEW was BEAUTIFUL!!! We didn't want to wait to sit outside (it's a Friday night and there was a 30 min wait) so we sat inside and every table had a great view of the bay. It wasn't overly noisy, perfect for our little one. Inside there was plenty of space and the tables weren't all crammed close together.

Overall good food, great service, and beautiful views of the bay. I'm so glad we stopped by for our visit to Tampa!

Also, there's plenty of parking at the beach right next to Whiskey Joes. Only costed $1. It was worth it parking there and walking a short way to the restaurant."
P0yn6ljHanh07h9XyOSgAg,1,"Hulk Hogan's restaurant. Dreadful food and service, plus the sleaze of association with Hulk Hogan. Parking is a nightmare too. Why waste a single penny here when there are so many other options in Tampa."
HZTHfeIzDTrfbiwVXSuM3g,5,"Came here for dinner when I was visiting Tampa with my parents. We all got different types of food (salad, wrap, tacos, burger) and it was all cooked perfectly and they give good portions too!"
Er4YT5O2i9M69E80pNgyFg,4,"Great time at Music on the Bay. Our server, Ashley S, literally ran her butt off for us, keeping us happy."
SfkVnjpKSrlhnfs8zw0vbQ,4,"We came to Whiskey Joe's expecting nothing but a good time, fun drinks and some appetizers. We sat in front of the large window looking over the water and people outside having fun. The view alone made me a fan. 

We ordered up three appetizers as our lunch, the half dozen oysters, the spicy shrimp and toast and the mussels appetizer. Each dish was good. I think the mussels were my favorite, although I am a sucker for oysters.

I ordered a Rum Runner and my guy went for a iced tequila shot and a Corona. We were celebrating the end of his business trip and the start of a fun vacation day together.

I enjoyed the hot sauce that they offer, it's actually got some heat to it. I would have bought it, but I didn't see it in the gift shop."
VKS5NlWCz6oHJbvzrrGg5A,2,"Deep fried everything!   A real grease pit.  Nice location on the bay, but that's about it. Service was acceptable, but nothing special."
pLv6SnVzlL9FFRxIpvS3Gg,2,"I got the chicken wings they were so chewy. It's a shame because the breading and sauce were pretty good. You could tell they were frozen. The fries were the best part of the meal. People I came with got mahi mahi and grouper sandwich. They said it tasted all right. Definitely not worth it for the price. Seems like more of a touristy spot, so if all you're interested in is mediocre food and atmosphere this is your place."
bLPINthln7rtGQh3jsgSXg,1,This place is terrible.  The food is bad. The alcoholic beverages have no alcohol in them but they charge you top self prices.  The view of the bay is beautiful but that's about it.
UxadKsq-FxAgw9X7MXAinw,2,"As others have said this place is a tourist attraction, especially with the gift shop. Starting with the atmosphere the Tiki-ish theme is cute and fitting for the area. The view is by far the best part about this place b/c the food was NASTY! 

Over priced for what was served, lacking quality and very poor presentation. The ""gator bits"" were gross, very rubbery, cold, under cooked, and over breaded. 

See pic of the remainder of my cheeseburger sliders for a good idea of what to expect. Yes I ate them b/c I was starving and they had good flavored beef, but there were so many things wrong with the entire dish. Little over cooked teaspoons of beef with american cheese on top placed on toasted tablespoon size wrinkled up sweet rolls is what arrived to the table. No vegetables on them, probably b/c that wouldn't all fit on the mini size slider rolls with the teaspoons of beef. The four ""sliders"" were surrounded by a boat load of crispy fries. The golden arches would have been a better choice for me. 

The drinks were decent but the view will be the only reason I would ever go back there. Service = 3, Food = 1, Atmosphere = 3, Location and view = 4."

5fLGdlLHPwZaAm0m2VQTKA,5,"Oh Whiskey Joe's how I love thee, let me count the ways! First, let me go back to the beginning. After flying all morning, a few of my travel partners and I decided to take advantage of our 4 hour layover and experience Tampa! Well, we really just needed a drink after the crazy past few days.  So in googling bars close 
to the airport, we found Whiskey Joe's!  Once we figured out how to escape the Tampa International Airport (that place is crazy), we hopped in an Uber and made it just before 11am.  The young ladies who greeted us were extremely welcoming and sat us on the outdoor patio where we met the greatest server EVER, Frank!!! He walks up to this group of ladies and says, ""We must be celebrating something if we left the men at home!"" With a little shimmy and shake! Frank was a riot and such a gentleman! When we expressed that we were in a time crunch, he effectively got our orders in and even got our checks to us early so that we could pay and dash!  NOW: on the food. Lord have mercy!  Have you ever..I mean ever had a sweet potato waffle fry?! Well these were sweet potato waffle fries on crack. Bacon, BBQ pulled pork with a savory cheese sauce, good enough to make you smack your momma (sorry Mom if you're reading this)!  We also had the Thai chili wings which were tasty, the American sliders and an assortment of drinks, ranging from The buzzkill to Vice City. There were no complaints.  The only issue was a renegade bee that was hell bent on ruining our outing but the gallant and noble Frank came to our rescue, yielding a towel which he used to chase the perpetrator away.  This was an amazing mini excursion that has sparked a desire to visit Tampa soon for more drinks, more delicious food, exceptional service and some beach time! If you get a chance, check this place out and ASK FOR FRANK!!"
Smk7ZO0ReDUuL5wRLQizZQ,1,"We've been here several times. In the last several months the service has been lacking and inattentive. Regardless of how busy they are, you have to be the one to initiate the service and you are often disregarded for over 15 minutes. We were waiting for over 10 minutes without any service at all before we decided to leave and take our party of 6 somewhere else that can provide good service and good food."
lWkP36tId1VBrGrFAyC-VQ,4,"This was my first time here and  Lily gave excellent service! They advertised on fb that happy hour was everyday 4-7. That was not the case, it is only on weekdays. Lily went above and beyond to accommodate is and definitely is the reason that I will be back!"
gP8QcQZ2n7EyTAMCYKaNvQ,5,"Great comfort food not the healthiest, but hey, go back to  your diet Monday! ask for Issy cool waiter, will make the experience that much better, I was hungover from the night before and got a banana to help ease my tummy.  Lol. great views of the bay, can always go next door afterwards seat at the beach and have another cocktail while listening to live music and bonfire right on the beach! Cheers enjoy."
g6PGGxEhw3yiLuDXHkEgwg,1,"Rough night.  The restaurant lost their system, which is bad.  But the management seemed to do nothing, electing to put the staff on the spot to figure out how to do tickets and get paid.  We had a leisurely meal and then another 100+ minutes of waiting on the check.  Just like all the tables around us.

Since I didn't want to penalize our wait staff, I've decided to pull down the reviews.  This one is on the management staff."
fGjVtA2BGFh7iRXHoioriQ,4,"Stopped in at this place while on vacation in Tampa from NYC two weeks ago. The (now ex) girlfriend did a random search for restaurants in the area & we decided on Whiskey Joes. 

The atmosphere was awesome, we ate outside & it was 75 at night in February on the water. We had Marshall as our server. He did an awesome job & was attentive to any allergies or changes we asked to make on our orders. 

The food was awesome. I suggest you try the fried alligator & the awesome choice of drinks they had. The grouper tacos were great too. Only thing is this spot was a little pricey for Tampa I feel, or it would've gotten a higher rating. It's a 3.5-4 from me. Best part though is it's literally ON the water, & they have a cool beach bar with firepits & live music. 

Try it though, you'll like it!"
iJZJxLhiamiwrl_nSVPqxA,4,"i will not give a 5 to any place i have only visited once, but this is a place i could see giving a 5 to in the future after more visits.  great view of the water, service was fantastic, and the food was great.  i had the run and coconut glazed beer battered chicken and it was fantastic.  

i ordered chips and queso as well, which being from Texas i am not used to having to pay for, but if that is my only complaint talk about first world problems."
UZt1hBcbTsfgD0SlFkwB7g,2,"with this place its really about local. great views,on the beach awesome! beautiful actually! everything is perfect even the hut-bar on the beach.the service was amazing,the prices werent bad but the food was.pre frozen crap that taste like the grill is dirty,i will be back for drinks only:)
important UPDATE!
if you buy drinks inside the resteraunt cause the bartender outside at the bar upstairs leaves for a halk hour at a time,she will see that beer,think someone gave it to you cause its not on your bill and double charge for it!!!!! seriously! you know what its like argueing about a bill when drunk! and trying to explain? and it makes you feel like a shithead cause they think youre lying? seriously? whos gonna lie about a few fkn miller lights after excess spending anyway? yikes."
sRG7MQZBHyFHtrG4D3w52g,4,"Good shredded pork sandwich, but no lunch pricing. It's all about the ocean view and people enjoying the beach while you sit in a/c comfort."
--2KOIf3Rg7qDqpaYVszbQ,1,"Great view, thats it. Entire table was sticky.Took 10 mins to even have someone come to our table for drink orders. None of the servers knew where any of the tables were-we literally watched our app go to each of the 8 tables before it finally hit ours. The food was WAY over salted. Our refills took forever and when asked about a beer i ordered and never recieved to be removed from our bill, the server said ""Well, its over on the bar"", as if i should have gotten it myself. 
Never again."
F6EI1q4dfNE0CZQCzySKvA,4,"This place is cool because of the location and boat access.  They have Deepwater between five and 7 feet with a marked channel coming into the restaurant. You can put your boat right on the beach and hang out while drinking or playing. A lot of people put lounge chairs in the water and enjoy and live music or DJ. 

We have not actually eaten their food yet but checked it out for a few minutes for future reference."
1zqIzqXmLj31WmVxOTRe7A,2,"Well. The food is not good at all. The clam chowder was cold and tasted flat out disgusting. The pulled pork sandwich was soggy, fell apart and was made very poorly. People next to me were complaining about the oysters. The bartenders were friendly. The Bloody Mary was delicious and the view is fantastic. The beer was all flat and tasted like the lines hadnt been clean. Don't think I'll be coming back, too many negatives. I honestly got the vibe that no one was in charge and people working just didn't care."
g_J6f2yvW44_aakEZ3_T4Q,2,"Went to Whiskey Joes with a pretty big group... about 15... the ambiance was pretty good... nice area... next to the beach area on the northern part of Tampa Bay... 
Selection of food was OK... The mussels were pretty good... gator bites were kind of salty... and garlic cheese bread got hard right away... 
a couple friends we were with were vegetarians and asked for a vegetarian pizza and nachos without any beef in it... when they got the orders, pizza was brought how it was asked but nachos initially didn't have any visible beef on it till our friend got to the bottom area... he had a couple of us try it because initially we suggested that it might just be re fried beans... but soon enough, we came to the conclusion that there really was beef in it along with the re fried beans... needless to say our group wasn't too happy about it... we gave it back to the waitress's was pretty polite and apologetic about it)... 5 mins after she took it, a supervisor (i'm guessing, he seemed like he was a supervisor or manager type) came over and apologized and said that our friend would get some nachos to go.. our friend said that it wasn't necessary... but soon enough some nachos came in a to go box... we opened it up because the nacho chips were falling out of it on the side of the box... and guess what we found in it, right smack on top... beef... mind you, my friend is a vegetarian and asked to have no meat/beef in his nachos in the first place and thus how we came to the situation... at that point we all just started joking around about it because it was kind of like an FML moment... the waitress once again came back apologetic, although this time she said it was the cooks fault... which we could see that... after that we asked for our checks... i left early with 2 other people and the rest of the group stayed but went on the beach area for drinks... 

attention to detail for specific needs is lacking... what if the person was allergic to beef? or even to another food item for that matter... that could have had serious consequences... when a person says that they don't want a certain thing in the dish, i think that it needs to be a coordinated effort between the waitress and cook on how the outcome would be..."
1E0l-p3ZjHBV0_NjTrApFg,2,"I've been to Whiskey Joes I believe 2 or 3 times now, and unfortunately each time I went the experience just got worse. My first rating would have been 4 stars, but I'm starting to think it was a fluke the first time we went. I've only ever sat outside, mostly because what my friends have said about the service indoors and even when I go in to use the restroom there's a funky smell in the lobby area. I don't trust funky smells...

Anyhow, as for my first experience oudoors, they still had the fire pits (before they apparently got destroyed in a tropical storm, bring those back!!) and they were AMAZING. We started out at the bar, which was nice, and moved to the fire pits later. Our bartender, a lovely blond, also made my friend and I some of the best drinks we haven't been able to find the equivalent of since. I really don't recommend this place for food, it's simply underwhelming for the price. Go for the drinks and the beach bar. The live music is also a nice touch.

Anyhow, the next time I went they had the tables in the sand instead of the pits, which were terrible because they did not hold the same appeal. First, they acted as heat traps and second, there was absolutely NO lighting so we could not see our food once the sun set. Thirdly, every single table we visited had biting ants! Someone is not paying attention. And the bartenders this round... oui. They delivered very poor service, food, and I was sure they did not know what they were doing mixing drinks. I don't know what you're doing taking a job as a bartender when you don't understand correct alcohol ratios. And the boys both seemed kind of ..... spacey. 

I just feel in general Whiskey Joe's could be a great place, their location is excellent, however I feel like they are a victim of neglect from management. The upkeep, server staff, and food quality are just not up to par."
zZHF43F15t7UAn0WeR0BkQ,3,"I was disappointed in this times visit.  I love the view and the outdoor seating, however, the food was not as great as the many other times we have been here.  The server, Rachael, was sweet and very good and offering suggestions when I couldn't make up my mind.  We had lunch on Sunday and perhaps we were a little too early for the chef to be at his best.  We will sure visit again."
g8AQkkRLeSSTYQyFEizfbw,5,"This place, along with the outside bar/beach area is what you expect when you go to Florida. The outside beach area is pretty busy, full of people of all ages. Great people watching, beach games, and plenty of good drinks.

The main restaurant food was decent. Plenty to choose from. Almost too much at times. But, hey, it's bar food primarily. But, what I really want to give a shout out to is the service. The wait service itself was very good. Very friendly, lots of staff. But the big thing for me was that I left something very important behind. I didn't realize it for a day or so and was in a panic. I realized I had left it at the outside bar. We called, and the owner was kind enough to agree to send it back to us in CT. All we had to do was pay for the shipping. Totally fair. A couple of weeks went by and it hadn't been sent. I called back, spoke to the owner and someone on his staff apologized profusely and had the item overnighted to me (Saturday delivery) on their dime. It was a relief. So, simply because of that, Whiskey Joe's will be the first place we go to when we get back down to the Tampa area. Check 'em out."
VgM3BvO_j1uvj6c20g3-zw,5,the servers inside are nicer than outside && the specials are better inside for happy hour! thank you to the bartender inside for my cup of pickle juice to make pickle backs w later! yur the real mvp!
5GLKsQeQoWbkIM_3QwS3Nw,2,"This place is a hot mess.  This review is bound to be confusing.

The pros?  The beach. The views.  The service.  Live music.  Recreation area.  Being able to pull up in your boat.  The bar area which is great for watching sports.

The cons?  The food is just meh.  The parking is a frigging nightmare.  The cocktails are very watery.  The place is terribly overpriced for such a mediocre meal.  

The absolute worst?  The seagulls.  They are EVERYWHERE. Despite the signs saying ""Do Not Feed The Birds"" you are bound to have some stupid tourist who thinks it's adorable to have the birds flying around you.  Have you people never seen a bird before?  

When these birds start swarming, it is a complete clusterf*ck of a mess.  They swoop down and eat your fries. Or, you could have an experience like I did where a seagull literally crapped on my forehead.  Yes, as I was sitting there eating my salad, a bird used me as target practice and crapped right on my forehead.  I thought it was a raindrop and told my husband that I think it was starting to rain. He looked up at me from his food and just stared at my face.  Then, he took a napkin and started to wipe my forehead.  I was extremely puzzled, but he didn't want to tell me that there was a big wad of green goo sitting above my left eyebrow.  The waitress happened to come out at that exact moment and started cracking up.

""Oh, that happens now and then""

Okay, great.  Thanks for that.  She didn't offer a napkin, or some water to wipe down my toilet face.  Needless to say, I was reasonably annoyed.  Yes, we laughed about it afterwards, but now, every time we pass by there, my husband just starts laughing which annoys the hell out of me.  But, whatever.  It's funny now but at the time, not so much.

If you are looking for beach ambiance, I would highly suggest sitting INSIDE at Whiskey Joe's.  And honestly, there are so many better places to eat in Tampa Bay that offer the same view with all the aforementioned pros along with better food, better parking situation, better drinks and better prices.

As for that seagull?  I hope a big ol' shark jumps up out of the Gulf and eats him.  Jerk."
BZ5GwOhx2wMRjiQo4zHKDg,3,"3 stars for the sunset view and a friendly waiter...we had the mussels, shrimp and sausage quesadilla, and fried swashbuckler basket.  The beer was cold, and the quesadilla was probably my favorite thing.  The fried seafood basket honestly reminded me of Long John Silvers.  I hate to compare them, but I kind of felt like everything was very overpriced for the quality.  I was not a fan of the key lime pie, either.  We ate at Bahama Breeze the next night, and while I know they are both tourist spots...there was no comparison.  Decent enough for beer and a view, but wished we had gone to Bahama Breeze both nights instead."
apxL5Xlz-VjKSXlZdPZrXQ,2,"This restaurant was just ok. We went there because we read that it was a great place to watch the sunset. The patio area was indeed a nice place to do that, and our bartender was very friendly. We had to wait quite a while to be seated inside, and then even longer for service and for food to come. We waited about an hour for our food. It was a busy time at the restaurant, but that still felt like a long time to wait. The drinks were sugary and not very strong at all. They have a lot of drink promotions, most of which will quickly drain your wallet without getting you tipsy. The food was pretty good -  a bit cold, but the snapper was very tasty. They give you huge portions...definitely enough for 2-3 meals, but that wasn't much use to us as we were on vacation and didn't want to take cartons of food back to our hotel. In the end, our bill was nearly $200 for four people...I didn't mind paying it but I can't help but feel that I didn't really get my money's worth."
DNeLdcaeIyLaxIK6xI3m8Q,3,"My overall experience was nice. I went there to celebrate Father's Day with family and friends. Our waitress was very pleasant, I ordered the Joe's Rocking Oyster which supposed to be stuffed with corn bread, corn, andouille sausage, crabmeat & pepperjack cheese. The only ingredient I tasted was the corn bread. The Chipotle Cioppino was excellent! Wish I could have gotten it over rice instead of pasta."
jHHfA4RPVh6kxoxM0pFQsQ,4,Great little spot right on the water. Kind of tucked away. Not super busy or touristy. Grouper tacos were huge and pretty good. Queso was great. Service was great. This would be a good place to stop if you want to stay close to the airport or don't want to hike all the way to Clearwater.
BTrDhEtwZbnpUWRK6rz0Lw,5,"An off the cuff stop while we had a couple of hours to kill was a wonderful experience. After dining on some amazing fish tacos and a pizza washed down with some marvelous cocktails, sitting while soaking our feet in the warm gulf waters was bliss.

Big props to Amy R for taking excellent care of us. We'll be sure to stop in next time we're in the neighborhood!"
xIc-1AYQNAnLq0Hzgz1gNw,5,Great ambiance. Great food- loved the gator bites. The best was the frozen mango mojito! I got the souvenir cup and filled it twice and felt awesome. Loved that it's by the water. Will come back for sure many time!
ptCoWmHtle9327TwJq5Qeg,4,"I had tried Whiskey Joe's at ZooFari years ago. I had really wanted to try their blackened fish sliders. I got that chance today.

We arrived at Whiskey Joe's around 12 noon. Now the place was pretty deserted at this time but it was filling up as we left. Since we got there early - we got a window seat.

I got the blackened fish sliders as requested. They came on the Hawaiian rolls and were excellent. They're also came with a half order of fries...they were also good. This was simple food but it was done very well. This isn't Bern's but then again, this place has a better  view than Bern's.

Whiskey Joe's is most certainly going to attract the tourist crowd, but I did notice a lot of locals there today. The view of the Hillsborough bay is very nice. They clearly have the best view of the bay from here. You are eating over the water. This restaurant is the only place I know on the Tampa side of the bridge where you can see an unobstructed view of the sunset.

I would go back to Whiskey Joe's in a heartbeat. I would like there to be some more people there while I was there, but that didn't change my rating."
OgTi_4zdOFhY2cTxbkfnMw,5,Vanessa is great.  She is on top of her game.  Makes excellent drinks.  Pays attention to the customers.  Remembers drinks.  Love coming to the beach and firepits.
Cvybk_7nGyYQogwgvcOOWw,1,Very  very poor service. When we parked the valet can flying though the parking lot in a costumers car only to yell at us for parking and when we mentioned it in side they didn't even care and from there it only got worst. Would not recommend on service alone
osIP1KjHXsAU-dxuWsEYjg,3,"Like this place..i've only been outside and never yet in the actual restaurant but the bar area is fun, great view and the bartenders are really nice! Beer prices could be better but you expect to pay a lil more in a place like this. It does seem like your in a resort outside..you can play bean bag toss, bonfires, swim, giant tiki hut...its a lot of fun. I havent actually actually eaten here yet but its ""on the list"". Take this place over next door Hogans anyday!!"
Ug-tGVLS-RlAw-23wFpxjQ,3,"I had high hopes for this place. It is in an awesome location right on the beach and you can see boats and jet skis pulling up. The huge tiki bar outside is on the sand which gives it a real beach feel. However it is extremely overpriced. I asked for a double house whiskey and diet and paid $14. I thought that was just absolutely ridiculous. Also, the outside bar smells like it needs a good hose down. Not only is the bar next to a series of Porta potties, but it just smells like it needs to be bleached or disinfected and had an awful stale liquid smell to it. The bar service was actually awful also outside so we had to go inside. The bartender inside was a lot better and able to accommodate not only the tables but her entire bar as well. Again, more overpriced drinks so we ended up leaving. I probably will not come back unless I won the lottery."
sBL1VTb4ocynHcOlr9MY-w,4,"Really good food and awesome atmosohere. I had the grouper sandwich which was excellent. Restaraunt is a little pricey and parking is terrible, however there is a beach bar WITH firepits and live music. Highly recommend!"
ESLqGnP_J_b8RtyvZI-_ww,4,We had lunch and drinks at Whiskey Joe's yesterday! The food was good and the beer was cold! Our waitress Christina was fantastic!! The staff was friendly and professional. We will go back! Thank you Whiskey Joe's
HFUYiu-slEAPkBCIGqUuew,3,Food is decent and the view is nice. I would recommend sitting at the bar for the best service. The servers are almost incapable of doing their jobs. Just walked out after 20 minutes with no service.
88cWqQ_sQ8994Tki7kHimA,4,"Spotted this gem while passing by. It looked like such a great spot to eat outside, we made a u-turn and were not disappointed.

Ordered the crab cakes, mani mahi tacos, and fire cracker shrimp tacos. I love Maryland blue crab cakes and these were a 4 out of 5. Fire cracker shrimp was the the best thing we ordered, tangy, and spicy, very fun. Mahi mahi was bland.

Great views of the bay and a great spot to eat outside. Maybe a great place to wait out Tampas rush hour."
IHoihEyC6KbcfNXYhnYEkw,1,"Worst valet, worst dead faced ladies/hosts as you walk in, and terrible customer service. Their was no one showing even a bit of excitement about their jobs. As a business owner from Las Vegas, NV I know how important it is to greet your customers and make them feel welcome.  This evening for the first time in a long time I felt bad for all the other people who too will have this experience after initially being excited to try something new."
sV5xcvV96bsxZgToaAHthA,4,Best freaking wings sweet coconut rum sauce will be back.first time here good service
a6AEHeTGzNAtNa5GrxccDA,5,"Fun location right on the beach! Was able to get a seat on the patio to watch the sunset, are waiter was awesome, and the food was good! It definitely has a tropical feel!"
Dyhr6zCKEKK9EzSS-dVueA,4,"We've been wanting to go to this place for a few weeks. We're very new to the area and decided to try it out the other day. It was pretty slammed there. They actually have valet parking. I'm not sure, but making a reservation is possible. We started off at the bar, but ended up moving outside. We ordered the whiskey pepper dippin shrimp (I had them put the gross feta on the side) and it was by far the most delicious shrimp dish I've had...maybe ever! 
My fella ordered the grouper with rice, broccoli, and got a GIANT Cobb salad (he had them bring out the salad first). The salad was amazing (juicy grilled chicken, bacon, mangos, and more) and could be an actual entree (without blue cheese, please). I got the fish (pollock) and chips. The seasoning on the fries was yummy and the fish was well-flavored. I will say we probably won't order all this food next time. We were wicked full after inhaling the app and salad. We had some full to-go boxes. Even though it was very busy, our service was solid and waitress was efficient. We'll go back again and try other stuff :)

(Edited May 28, 2017...They no longer serve the whiskey dippin shrimp and that was my favorite thing on the menu. We came back a few times after finding that out and haven't been back anymore)."
slbWivHrwHs917P9zVqq8A,3,"This is a great place with phenomenal scenery and even better food. Some of the best nachos I've ever had. My friends and I like to come here to explore the drink menu and enjoy these nachos. I was there today and the waiter I had was one of the rudest most unprofessional waiters I've ever seen. He clearly seemed bothered to be serving for your establishment. We ordered nachos with no meat because a friend is a vegetarian, his response was why don't you just get chips and Queso. My other friend asked to order a drink he rolled his eyes and said sure very snarky. After we enjoyed the natural and a round of drinks I decided I wanted to order some. Unfortunately I cannot tell you how these because our waiter do not come back for at least 30 minutes. We had to ask another waitress to get our checks well he still had 10 feet away staring at usAfter receiving my check I forgot that I wanted to get my whiskey Joe points. I turned around and flagged him like you do do anyway and are in an establishment. He told his table to hang on because we want to do something again. At which point the girl again came to take care of it. Unfortunately he did not even give us a name or gladly tell you it was. Feel free to message me and I will give you. Info to pull my check."
IVP5c8NosQr9jOWWuwER_A,5,"This place is awesome, and the wait staff is great.  Jenn took care of us all day and we had a huge group. She rocks! If you're looking for fun in the sand and close to Tampa, this is your place. Boaters welcome too!"
kSKZsiPVsJF6muNzCa8L0A,2,"Whiskey Joe's is like Jimmy Buffet's Margaritaville or Sammy Hagar's Cabo Wabo minus the celebrity name.  The location is actually quite nice, right on the water and there is a public dock to tie up your boat.  There are beach volleyball nets nearby and the people watching can be decent.  That being said, the food is unremarkable and the drinks are average.  The place screams tourist trap yet a number of locals seem to find their way there.  Give it a try, but don't say I didn't warn you!"
vwCqQzSGgNrdOXdHsOCD0A,5,"I had the pleasure of visiting for the first time since I moved to Tampa on last weekend. The food was really good and the service was pretty fast. I sat outdoors with a view of the water. My waitress was absolutely amazing. Christine G. - Somehow she managed to run the outside bar, while taking orders and making sure that I had everything I needed. I was really impressed. She's a gem Whiskey Joe's.

I had the Grand Grouper Sandwich along with the Island Firecracker Shrimp. Both were tasty items.

If you haven't visited this place, give em a try. It's a lively place on a Sunday! Guaranteed to have a great time."
PIXGCR7Wsf5HjdigkcsisQ,4,"We dined outside so we could enjoy the water and the beach-goers while we consumed our meal.

The service was a little slow, but the staff was friendly enough.

Eventually we moved fron a high table to the bar in order to avoid cigarette smoke. That move gave us an even better view of the jet skiers.

The gumbo was delicious and filled with vegetables & andouille sausage. The jerk chicken sandwich was fresh and the chicken seasoned perfectly. I really enjoyed the fries that were crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside."
HbsRVtyQQJWqLihv43_QSA,5,Chilling and some good drinks and a nice party with my wife. Awesome place to stay and have fun
6DcSC9rKNAdOVLJjObyMzw,5,"We have been here half a dozen times, and have never been disappointed. Great food, great beer selection, and a wonderful beach area with a third bar on the sand.
We watched a great Van Halen cover band here. Great service, good prices, clean establishment. My wife and I are huge fans of this place!"
uZafBR8T3UpODJ59sDX6sA,5,"I don't know if we got lucky or what, but I showed up on a random chilly Tuesday evening with about 25 coworkers who just made it into town but we still had awesome service! I think there was maybe one bartender and one server, but they kept up just fine. Try the WJ's blonde if you're a beer drinker!"
4DnvTR95UWVH-CXmV9mB8w,2,"One of my first dining experiences while visiting Tampa and just let me say, I was hoping Tampa had better to offer.

We ordered the following:

1. Sliders
2. Calamari
3. Oysters
4. Shrimp

Food was standard. Nothing really special. Things seemed as though they were thrown together.  Nothing tasted great and everything tasted average.

Service wasn't very good. Although the place was empty, it took a while for waiters to come serve us. 

Nice view of the bay. Just about the best part of the experience."
Mg1KAzFVcuWN6ZZIQfZ4bw,3,Only stopped by for a few drinks after visiting the train wreck across the water known as Hogans beach. The place was nice but not very crowded at all. I like how you can sit by the water with your toes in the sand and just relax. Other than that they had decent music and one hott bartender out of 4.
TkGRbz566qTHc6Xm34C9Xg,2,"Great location, superb view and beautiful server, but don't go there for the food or drinks. Seafood is bland and bad prepared, the scallops tasted like cardboard and the mango sauce only diminished the dish. The shrimps were overcooked, too fried and a funky hot sauce"
FWXKN7YTkohN_y2MRUIqxw,2,"I would give this restaurant one star if it weren't for the location. Service is slow. A bit pricey for what you get. I was there two weeks ago and ordered nachos.  I specifically ordered them with no tomatoes.  But, I got a plate of nachos loaded with tomatoes. So I had to send them back. Guess what? Got my second plate of nachos with tomatoes. Again! What is going on here? Never going back."
jmRkfRNw1STx-kWuI5ipcg,5,"Best tiki bar around! Good size beach, tiki tables, fire pits, a stage and dance floor. Great place to have a good time. Great vibe! The TVs were a tad small (I was trying to watch football), but with such a great atmosphere it's not a deal breaker. 

Our bartender Caroline was fun and attentive. 

This is going to be a regular stop."
33TzKqFs8-58QnF5m5Zr8A,3,"Great sunsets; limited menu more like Joe's Crabshack...Had the blacken Grouper...Overall good atmosphere for a large group...reminds me of Seacrets in Ocean City, MD..."
fGFkfq4Utg9-w8U5xZMNLw,1,Worst service ever waited over 30 min to have a waitress come over I guess they were too busy texting and doing there hair at service bar so decided to leave just absolutely terrible do not go great view great location and can not tell u more when no one cares to make money wanted to make a day of it spend some money they lost a customer for life and will tell every one I know not worth it !!!
DzVgq1zBIZDxBjtJpPztJQ,3,"We had some friends from California come to visit and had driven past this place heading to the beach. When we drove by it looked really full of life and cool so we drove out the following day. 

We got there really early as we had only planned on staying for a couple of hours. We walk to the beach/outside area and they have a DJ and lots of people crowded around the bar (it was a Saturday about 11ish or 12 if I remember correctly). The seating is first come first serve there's plenty of tables and chairs that don't have shade (which is kind of disappointing as it gets hot in the sun) but then there's also tables hut style with shade but those are the first ones taken of course. We got lucky that as we got there someone was leaving so we were able to find seating.

They head to the bar area which is super packed and kind of all over the place. Took forever to get our drinks and the area kind of smelled (could be because the porter potties are literally right next to the bar) so we only got up when we needed a drink. Come to find out there's waiters walking around so we really didn't have to walk up!! We never got greeted or asked if we were helped so that was a huge let down! 

We go to the bar to order some appetizers as we started to get hungry. We then had to keep going to the bar to keep checking on our order because the bartender said to come check on it. They don't bring it to us. Aside from it being pricey the portions were okay but it's not like you get what you paid for. We ordered gator bites they weren't all gator bites they threw in fried pickles and onion rings with the calamari. Wish I would've taken pictures.

We got tired of having to get up and walk to the bar so we were able to finally flag down a waitress. She was very friendly (forgot her name) though we had to flag her down ever so often but it beat having to go to the bar. 

The DJ was cool so the atmosphere was great. There was also hookah available which was even better. We had such a blast we didn't leave until 530 or 6 lol!"
fcpZaQrEnShRiiizwGcYrA,5,Came here after a cruise and before a flight (had about 5 hours to kill). They stored our luggage for free. We ate at the restaurant and then hung out at their private beach until we needed to go to the airport. There are showers and bathrooms so perfect for travelers. Right next to the airport so we didn't hit any traffic. Very friendly staff!
cyGrSwJLA77nFN70C7SvWA,1,"This is a criticism. I ordered a dozen oysters and got 8. I ask about the count and they said because they were so big that they only serve 8. The menu says clearly states half dozen and a dozen, not weight. Just because they buy large oysters is not my problem. They need to change the menu if They want to change by the weight. I have been coming here for 5 years and this has never been a problem. This is just an example of low character of the management on duty, But to be fair it is usually a good bar and the wait staff is very excellent"
XvGorQDSWY-Xc8hlAFRIlA,1,Very subpar. Read other yelp reviews and hoped it was ok here anyway. Nachos had a big meatball of taco meat which was very pink inside. Find somewhere else.
dZZu279ip3tgDfGKgVcuuA,5,"Came to Whiskey Joes for lunch. It has great sitting outside on the patio and inside with wide open windows overlooking the ocean. Amazing views and their portion sizes of food are excellent for sharing! 
I ordered their bowl of Spicy Island Gumbo ($8 & large size) and it tasted good and could be a meal if you were looking for a little bit lighter lunch portion. Also ordered the Snapper in Paradise which was at least a 6oz piece of fish topped with tomatoes and sauce that was delicious. It came with two sides and I ordered the broccoli and fries. ($26) Wasn't too fond of the broccoli, needed seasoned and was half way raw. It is slightly higher in price, but know that their portions make up for it and the sizes are worth the price. 
Only other thing that I didn't know is that there is valet parking only in their lot which is $5. 
I didn't get to go on the beach area because it was windy and slightly raining, but looks great and relaxing! Will be back to sit out and relax in the sun!

*************
Updated September 5, 2018

Came here for lunch today and went out to the beach area for the first time. What an amazing spot to sit, relax, listen to music, have a cocktail and some great tasting seafood! 

Tons of beach chairs to sit on (none to lay on to tan your back side) with tiki huts and high tops to sit at as well. They have a nice large tiki bar outside with full bar and a few TVs. You can order food at the bar and they will bring it out (look out for seagulls!) 

Ordered the coconut crusted mahi on the appetizer menu and it was delicious! It was $14 with two kinds of sauces including mango / orange flavor and a sweet chili sauce which were both good. And large portion! Def can split this appetizer or have it as your meal. Great food and view of the ocean! Can't wait to come back for their happy hour from 4:00-7:00"
sq_XyBf-44OoouaLrgQtWA,4,"Best Beer Cheese Soup in town and the Calamari Appetizer was great, but prices are a little high though."
ZhtT-3MtH1wK8AmDYTQZZg,1,"Very disappointing meal. The beer wasn't cold but the food was. After sending back a raw hamburger, I received another that tasted like it was made the day before. My wife had the fish tacos. They were ok, but nothing spectacular. The views of the bay are great, too bad the food doesn't match."
GEla4jl3yIwOKauf6VJ_nw,3,"Great for casual waterfront dining or drinks. The food is good, but priced a little higher than maybe what it should be. They have a great beer selection along with a full bar. It is a great place to watch the sunset on a nice evening. They are dog friendly on the deck. 

Also, if you are driving know that the parking lot is valet only (it is complementary, but if you don't have extra cash for a tip it can make for an awkward interaction)."
tsxb6rGJno0jtVQPhIlm7A,3,"New Years was awesome! Two bands, one inside and one outside on the beach. Low cover and plenty of drinks. The staff were very nice. Great way to bring in 2017."
kR8mZOZ3brsbQa7ncUeLzQ,3,"Food was alright, service not so good but our waitress/bartender was nice. the view was great and really enjoyed the sun set on beach and drinking hurricanes."
mG7JhTXYi4lXVT9_mOTt7A,2,"We sat on the ""beach"" and enjoyed some adult beverages while listening to the loudest, most annoying rap music ever.  Sorry - I want Jimmy Buffet or Bob Marley while on the beach.  Hate rap so it will always effect my reviews.  Food was bad too.  You would think an order of peel and eat shrimp on a Florida beach would be a no brainer but this was tasteless and mushy.  Waitress though was really good and attentive - 4 starts for her - just wish I could remember her name!"
nlNCCvuu88ZCCssLz9ASmQ,1,"WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!! I've ordered take out before and loved the coconut chicken. However this time we decided to go in and enjoy the atmosphere (Terrible decision). The food was dropped off by another employee who we asked if we could have silverware. 5 minutes go by no silverware and our server was no where to be found. We then went to the bar and asked for silverware but we're not given napkins. We were hungry so we started eating but eventually wanted napkins, of course server still no where to be found. We asked another employee for napkins and then our server came out of no where and began cussing and arguing with us saying he gave us silverware..? We asked to speak to a manager instead of being cursed at and the manager didn't do anything but take a drink off of our check. Not to mention the entire time the server was standing behind the manager flicking us off. This is unbelievable service for a place in such a nice location. I will most definitely never come back nor will anyone I know if it's up to me."
_ZztgJwTjmbDkQtaJrUg_Q,1,Extremely dissatisfied and disappointed customer a group of us about 50 people ages 40 to 60yrs from Apollo Beach got together and had a pub crawl  wiskey Joes  was our 2nd stop it all started 1st Beach area was not open as promised so group had to go in by bar area then ordered a drink then bartender wouldn't take credit card for payment because no chip in card said it was their policy so told her forget it here's cash then went to patio outside with wife and friends we are all standing talkin all sudden  a staff member comes rushing out  to patio agressively and raised voice at me asking if I put the umbrella up I said no then he says just leave it don't touch it and storms off I'm looking at everyone like what just happened.then one of the ladies in our group was celebrating her birthday so part of group started singing  Happy birthday and then manager comes over and says everyone in group is now cut off from food and alcohol and some people already ordered and paid for food which some didn't even get to enjoy their meal basically paid for something for nothing.and they kicked us out what a shame this is how they run a business turning away people who can spend money  which most business would welcome shame on those who manage to run this place along with  staff. U are going to sink this business u keep this up and don't wisen up
WeWgP4AZ_end3QQjxvckGw,1,"This place sucks. Takes an hour to get food, and nothing special about the food. Their house beers aren't good either, best to stick to some craft beer."
lm2Aq_Q7l1pR7YKK6xHkaQ,5,"Awesome spot right on the beach! Easy to get to & very accommodating! Casual and fun, you can sit outside right over the water or stay inside with great water views too! They have multiple bars and fun coconut drinks. I had the best fish sandwich - huge portions & bf had the white sand pizza. Both very delicious as we sat and looked out at the water & the Pelicans.

Our waiter, Alex, was extremely friendly and happy to serve us! He made it a fun time here right from the start! ask for him! 

This has been one of the best spots I've been to yet down here in FL!"
gWoKMY8xojT9Tf42OAE0Nw,2,"If I could give an extra half star I would it does not quite rate the full 3.  The service was slow, the food was less than stellar but.... i knew what i was getting into.  what this place my lack in quality and efficiency it makes up for in location....  it is literally just a couple of minutes from the airport and makes a great ""last stop before you go"" place to grab a cocktail as you await your flight (or waiting to pick someone up).  Sand, Water and a tiki bar!   I will say that the parking is a nightmare so your best bet is to just pay for valet.....  but again, its a BAR ON THE BEACH, that was what I was looking for!"
r8IYIOP53FoHWkGRIsqPAA,1,"We visited this terrible establishment on New Year's Eve in which we were greeted with judgement, outrageous prices for bottom shelf liquor and ran out of Yeungling after one drink ( both times I've been here they run out after one drink). If you enjoy being overcharged for crappy drinks and average food then this is the place for you. I recommend this place dearly to all of my enemies. Never. The portopotties are free, but you lose a few ounces of humanity and if you want to use the facilities inside you have to pay a cover. WTF? Sincerely a disgruntled customer"
xyTEuV8XIOj9SQH7A2Zgvw,3,"The food is fine - typical beach bar food. The PARKING IS HORRENDOUS. They have only valet parking and when that fills up they tell you to park off site at another location. The process is longer and annoying and it will make you 30-45 minutes late if you have an reservation. The hostess staff was also not very understanding or helpful in regards to some of our party being delayed due to Whiskey Joe's parking situation breakdown. Go to the light and make the U turn because you'll wait 20 minutes to turn into the restaurant only to be told you can't park there. UPDATE: Valet parking is $5 and cash only at the off site parking with a free shuttle. Those guys are awesome and really put up with a lot, tip them well! The free parking ,on the very small Ben T Davis Beach, is not an ideal option because you enter and exit from the same point as WJ customers. The beach parking is backed up with a line of cars waiting to exit but only after the cars entering the lot to try to valet park clear up. I watched them to sit in their cars to leave the lot longer than I did to enter it. It would have been helpful if at the time our reservation was made we were told ""Hey, it gets insanely busy and packed here. Your party should arrive 30-45 minutes early.""  We spoke to our server about her experience and they also are late due to the same traffic issues as was the server/worker who was in the free shuttle ride with me. Spring break or not, we have great weather most of the time, I'm positive this is a regular occurrence. Just be ready to deal with some hassles and to wait, prepare in advance. I wish someone told us - so I'm telling you. BTW-uncle bens minute rice is very TYPICAL - I didn't say it was bad, it's just what you would expect."
czd6qxI0m-v43CNlww2fjQ,3,"I went here on a Sunday, which is reggae night and there is a cover charge to go down on the beach. The only reason why I went here is because I had a friend coming into town and she wanted to go here so I met her there.

The parking is ridiculous. Most of the lot is valet and if they are full you are screwed. When I first arrived, it was full so I had to go to the adjacent beach parking to try and find a spot. The parking machine was not giving people receipts, which you are supposed to put on your dash so they know you paid. I did not put money in and decided to try the restaurant again because in the meantime my friend got there and she was able to park. Well the parking gods must have smiled on me because I snagged a non-valet spot on the way to valet.

I am in my 40s and this is not my scene. The waitress was dingy and I paid cash because I didn't feel comfortable giving them my card and having them hold it at the bar.

The place was pretty packed though and there were cops watching from a deck above, as well as cops patrolling the water because the waterway is between two party spots (this place and the Beach) so I would say that is plus.

There did seem to be a pretty good band that was starting when I was going home so it may be a really good place to go for live music.

I think I would feel different about the place if parking wasn't such a pain and if I was on vacation.  I live here though and in Pinellas County there are a lot of beach bars I would pick over this place, but because it is located in Hillsborough, near the airport and hotels, I am guessing it is popular among people who don't want to drive all the way out to the beach."
JH_Nhne10jTIygTpLMWkFg,3,"VEGAN REVIEW: We came down for Parents weekend at UT and this place was a request of non-vegan family members. Full disclosure we did review the menu beforehand and saw there was only 2 possible items that could have been veganized: Hummus appetizer and a veggie pizza. 
Great ambiance with that Caribbean outback vibe. Pulling up... there is a long valet line and long waits for tables. If you want to skip the restaurant, the ""beach"" is first come first serve. More about that later. 
We opted for outdoor seating on the water. Pretty views and the weather was perfect for outdoor dining. Our waiter was friendly and accommodating. Fun drink menu with zany names and concoctions. We ordered the hummus plate as an appetizer without the tsaztsiki.  It was actually the best hummus plate I've had aside from Greek restaurants...came with olives, marinated cherry tomatoes, banana peppers, pita and cucumbers. We asked our waiter if the chef could prepare something special for us considering they had pasta and veggies. He made a linguine with brushetta, olive oil and mushrooms. I requested a side of the mango salsa and mixed it in there. It was decent for a meal but I wonder why they couldn't have a black bean burger on their menu. I find this so often and news flash: veganism isn't a new fad...it's been around for 70+ years as an American lifestyle and diet and much longer in other cultures. I understand a local whiskey seafood shanty isn't going to have garlic roasted tofu with a balsamic reduction over steamed quinoa but is a black bean burger with avocado and mango salsa too much to ask for? 
And the beach...we decided to go check it out. Definitely a fun place to hang. Firepits, tiki torches, live music, cocktails, sand...what's not to love? Good times and definitely a place I'd love to return to as soon as they get a couple more vegan options."
0U2xKKDckA1HXd7HpIqNtA,4,"We had a great time here yesterday. We have only been once before and we really like it. 
Julia is a great bartender and we will definitely be back."
-2NJGWUJtxBEmCDuQL_gIA,3,"We discovered this great spot on a business trip to Tampa. The food, service, and atmosphere were excellent. Our server Neil, took such good care of us and was a great person! There is a deck to sit and enjoy the view too."
bjBn650FTyk0wZIgLkF03A,4,"Amazing location! On the beach with the coolest vibe. Watching the jet skiers was great and the sunset was beautiful. You can eat on the deck or on the beach. My sister and I ate inside seated by the windows. Great view! The staff are pleasant and helpful. My sister had the Jerk chicken sandwich and fries. She said it was very good. I ordered the grouper sandwich that came with fries, coleslaw. The grouper was bland, not even salt. It could have used some seasoning like garlic, salt, paprika and crushed thyme. Try it! The fries were to salty. The drinks were great! Atmosphere great! The grouper average. You may wonder way I gave them 4 stars. I'm not going to give them a low score based on one bland meal."
ohCo18s397kRq9FEIgB1vw,5,"Had the carnitas, 10/10 would come again, prices aren't terrible considering the area, and the proportions were handsome."
MXpXFW4J4j-NBDVaZZJcdw,4,"We had the Jamaican fish and the fried seafood platter. Everything was excellent, but the Jamaican sauce was just ok (not great). Prices are very reasonable considering the quality of the food. Service outside by the bar was fast and polite. The food came out quickly and the sunset was beautiful. I highly recommend!"
rxowN5BLo25EQyT8BtmXwQ,5,Recommended by my sister and was not disappointed. Wings were exceptional and calamari strips were very good!  Drinks were on point and souvenir cups were a nice addition for keepsake purposes.  Enjoyed the view as well.  Thanks!
21rqpANHZBNpIiqOWvfeNA,5,"I was in town and my friend brought my here. The food was amazing and plentiful. I also love that they had the outside bar on the water. We ate inside and then went outside. The service inside was great. The service outside could have been better, seems like it took forever to get anyone's attention. I would definitely come here again when I'm in town."
yAC8dyU7a_lFUIYXV_WRXw,4,"What a great spot to enjoy a view of the water with a cocktail and grab a bite to eat. We had the grouper sandwich and the mini sliders, have I had better, yes but the food was still pretty good. Lets face it you go to the place for water views and fun. Joe's has a big deck with a 8 seat bar that looks over the water, seems likes a good place to grab the view you probably came here for. They have a barefoot beach bar that looks like fun too if you want sand in between your toes and a cold beer in your hand."
7aDDuXJ3P47rClwG7TK3Rw,5,Killer on the beach joint! Blackened fish tacos local Cigar City beer! Great server thanks Beth!! Must do classic Fla place!
mS-L1kYkOg3RCJ064NeOWw,4,"Being an out-of-towner, this place was recommended to me by a few different people. It did not disappoint. Large beach with fireplaces set up for these cool October nights. Good selection of local craft brews. The food for our party of three arrived on time ,was piping hot and tasted delicious. The view of the Bay from our little Tiki table was also soothing and relaxing, especially watching the boats come in and dock."
WcAdmfZwtkxlJi0CzLhs4Q,3,"I can not believe I never reviewed this place. Why have I gone here a bunch of times?  Well, it is a step from the airport. People I pick up from the airport or take to the airport end up here.
This place has a great view of the water. This is a typical touristy place where you feel like you are in Florida bc the sun is shining in all directions and the heat is permeating you to the max. It's nice and they have tiki huts also that I have not been able to get to. They allow dogs as well. The menu is the usual grill kind of place and not that extraordinary. The drinks are great though and they have great service. I'm sure I will be back when I have more visitors come."
17JpJHNoGhMy9tm4ExeOOg,4,If you want a restaurant where you can watch the sunset on tampa this is the place. They have a private beach with corn hole and volleyball along with a beach bar. The food here is ok but I like whiskey joe's more as a place to hangout and grab a drink with my toes buried in the sand.
ob1lExlOzBq1W07s8HWMdQ,4,Beautiful place to relax with a few drinks and watch the sunset. At night they have bonfires scattered along the beach and it's a very relaxed atmosphere with great music. They also have jet skis to rent if you're feeling a little adventurous!
4WlgVyCVpRa-QtC3i9Mc0w,2,"Honestly, this place was a HUGE disappointment. We had slow service from start to finish. It took 20+ minutes to get our drinks and another 30+ minutes to get our appetizers. Conveniently, it took 10 minutes to get our main dishes. I ordered the Jambalaya, which was delicious and very hot, temperature wise. My friend ordered the Shrimp Tacos which was all mayonnaise and grease with ice cold fried shrimp. One side of the table was given their plates of food while the other side of the table waited another 10 minutes for their food. The waiter completely forgot to get one of our friend's food. I will say that we had a 12 top table, but the restaurant appeared very slow. They didn't even give our waiter a helper given the party size. He spent so much time running around and he seemed very flustered."
XccaAj3Ug1oExof6aoJrMw,3,"Basically a beach bar targeting tourists.   A fine view or Tampa Bay from the Tampa side of Courtney Campbell, with lots of deck seating and natural breeze.  Drinks are fine but predictably pricey.  Service is relaxed.  Just had some apps from the usual list of tacos, wraps, and fried seafood."
9s1O8kZ0eDucGiD1mXDDjQ,4,"A way to spend a Sunday afternoon, right on the water. The drinks tasty and the food was  good, the only complaint was the required valet service. There was a wait for us to retrieve our vehicle and congested leaving the parking lot."
vW4ucOkxBD0c6TyhubHI_w,4,"i super enjoyed this place, i had the carnitas and they were spectacular, also tried the pork tacos which were full of so much pork, omg so good!  be cautious of the pizza though, its listed as ""new york style"" and its simply a flatbread pizza, that's not new york style at all, it tasted good though, just thought we were getting something else"
OyJfnRY98Ua9HprmCVp8bg,4,"I liked everything here, from food to ambience. A perfect place to have good food and enjoy a beautiful sunset. Being on a sea shore is just the right place to be in  loved it!"
Vxyvje5MzvkPCAQVABxkuA,4,"Yes the uniforms the staff has to wear hurts my eyes and you know you are at some type of tourist location as you pass through Ye Olde Gift Shoppe on your way in and out of the attraction but...
I've only eaten there recently at lunch and was lucky enough not to get attacked or by a flock angry sea gulls and if they would have pooped on me I would have ran, ran so far away I could have got away.
Back to the food, two salads, one appetizer and a couple of glasses of house Sauvignon were ordered. I have to agree it was not the least expensive lunch and if it wasn't for the beautiful surroundings, pleasant staff and decent food I would probably drive past in the future but...."
Oh7fhApyPGDORtXBb34iJQ,5,"Have to start with the view. The wife and I are huge fans of food on the water, especially coming from the desert, and Whiskey Joe's doesn't disappoint. It's right on the causeway and the patio is right on Tampa Bay. We went for mid-week lunch and I wish I had tried the gator bites. The firecracker shrimp tacos were fantastic as was her requisite chicken sandwich since she doesn't eat seafood. Service was solid ... and did I mention the views?"
_4iGrX9vpfPPwHT40pjaEg,3,"I have been going to Whiskey  Joe's  since the original one opened. Yes, it can feel touristy, but if you are a Native, it can also feel like home.
Surrounded by Tampa Bay, a beack, outside bar, Tiki, you can put your toes in the sand & bring your best 4 legged friend. Who can't find something to love about that vibe, not me.
Parking is a pure nightmare! Just be prepared for it before you go & it won't ruin your fun. Service is generally good, as they want to keep you eating & drinking. The food, defiantly not stellar or even close.
I used to experiment with different dishes and just got too frustrated. I really enjoy their Wisconsin  Cheddar  soup & boiled shrimp, a perfect meal for me. You can't mess up the soup, it's  premade. The shrimp occasionally  come overcooked or too soggy, but they have no problem replacing them.
A great place to chill and enjoy where you live!
What's  a  girl  to  do? Try to enjoy where I live & take advantage of places that put me in my element of water & sunshine."
Nckabh7u9OUDz5FjAQc19Q,2,Nice view on water.  It was recommended by the concierge desk at hotel.  Limes in my mojito were old. (brown edges)   The blackened grouper was average.   Not much fish and the shrimp rubbery.
hNkAZaheHk3PBMrtr38CSw,1,"They get a 1 star because it was a gorgeous place to eat with a gorgeous view. But everything else was bad. My wife had a live beetle crawling around the pecans in her salad. And that was their signature salad.  They took it off the bill but didn't offer a bug less one. We called ahead for a party of 12 and then waited more than an hour after we got there. They had quoted 30-40 minutes.  The service was excruciatingly slow.  The fish dinners were too greasy to eat.  We don't recommend the swashbuckler as it is just a tub of greasy fish and fries. We would never go there again, and everyone in our party agrees. Save yourself from starvation and wanting to throw up and go somewhere else!"
blMl9S8TfTDphqzQK-lljQ,3,Whiskey Joe's has done a lot to improve this restaurant over the years. The have waterfront seating and a beach tiki bar. Both make for an enjoyable Florida atmosphere when the weather is right.  During my recent visit I got the naked colada which is basically a pina colada mixed with delicious black spiced rum. The Jamaican Jerk chicken sandwich was served with yummy fries. Both were pretty good. Sit outside and enjoy a frozen drink....it might smell a little funky....don't worry you get used to it :)
zH5f8UVej3Lm5rgwOIXMyQ,1,You completely suck as an establishment. Unprofessional staff including management. Place for drama and boring. You can't handle large groups. You lose profit because of how you run your business. You cater to trash instead. You turn down people that can actually spend money here and trash talk to other businesses if those groups are headed there. Don't bother to have your piss aunts even communicate on your behalf. You will loose a lot of business.
YMNQGflQshhrYgUF2qOC1g,5,"Totally confused about the low ratings I'm seeing. Stumbled upon this place on our way to Clearwater. Jumped off of the road to grab lunch and ended up staying and enjoying the awesome beach ambience. I had the shrimp scampi appetizer and my friend had fish and chips. We also shared a nacho/queso/beef appetizer. We enjoyed everything we had!! The bartenders were great at the bar and we enjoyed our drinks, as well. We came back later the same night because they have a separate tiki bar, firepits, & performance stage. We had a blast listening to the DJ and later the live band. We also ended up eating dinner there. My friend had the steak tacos and I had wings. We enjoyed our dinner, too! Perfect beach bar, equipped with entertainment at night. Can't beat it!!!"
S41Y1dM6oP3fbfVLY3Qjig,1,If I could select NO STAR I would. Horrible service and really quite frankly the WORST food I have EVER had!!!! It was so bad that I actually threw up shortly after the dinner. Over cooked fish and microwaved veggies!!! We also ordered pizza that totally was freezer burned with bad veggies! Do NOT go here. You have been warned!!
sW0cxu1_WuOK1tb77h-gyg,4,"You really can't beat the view here. They have their own private sandy beach. I chilled with some good friends earlier in the day on a weekday so it wasn't that busy, which was great because iv'e seen this place get PACKED!  
There is nothing better than some cold beer on a hot ass day with some sandbags to play a few games of sand bag toss with your buddies. We stayed and watched the sunset. Tried some food, the fish tacos were nasty, my friends had the pulled pork sandwiches. Too salty for them. The food is meh. 
Don't expect it to be as great as the view. I would have rated it a five if the food was good. Whiskey Jose's is a wonderful hang out if you are lookin to have a good time with your friends and get some drinks."
AvqrzpS-mQ78C3qmqWkyNw,2,"The owners certainly listened in school when they taught the #1 rule of business is location, location, location! Unfortunately I think they realize they will be successful on tourists regardless of service or food. Service was a cluster; table next to us was smoking cigarettes non-stop until I had to say something; and WHO THE F? SERVES SEAFOOD GUMBO WITH RAW UNCOOKED RICE?????!!!!"
90GFdiCTxSgFKHYr1tVCjA,3,"This place is located near the airport so it is a great palce to head to if i ever have a friend or family friend on a layover between catching their next flight. We inicially came here because we wanted to have a beer while watching the sunset. Whiskey joe has limited free parking but they have paying parking nearby. During happy hour this place is packed. They had yeunling at $3 and some drinks at $6.  On our first round we ordered two yeunglings but on our second round i decided to try the margarita and it was not worth it. Next time i'm sticking to beer. We also wanted to share a bite to eat and ordered flat crusted cheese pizza (8 pieces). It was just ok- nothing to write about but i would not order it again. I would probably return when if a friend is on a layover. Other than that, i'd probably head elsewhere."
SyaJYTPkxUlwIwUsTRVrHw,1,I ordered the gator bites & we got more fried pickles than gator bites never again! They slackin! The server did nothing about it either!
5lagx1093q9OiKApb_jeAA,5,Amazing food!! Veggie pizza is a must! Their beach bar is the perfect place to unwind and the live music is always entertaining! Reasonably priced as well!! Must visit!
mTChAqOuAhzsfRxbs2V63Q,5,"In town for the Memorial Day Holiday Weekend, and stop here for drinks and food! The view is awesome!!! Had some great food and an OUTSTANDING server, ARI! She was very helpful with items suggestions on the menu, very friendly, great customer service! If you are in the area, please stop in and enjoy great water views, live music, and ask for ARI for superb service! Thanks ARI!!!"
AgnzP_vGC5myPktdOb0eGg,4,"Great location, good food. Prices are a bit high for the quality but the location doesn't get better. Great for any age or crowd. Beautiful sunsets."
EbxyUVB3OXeAx6H95KRn1A,1,"We never actually got to order any food.  When we arrived, we were told there would be a 30 minute wait.  We decided to wait )wound up being 45 minutes).  When we were seated, took another 30 minutes until someone took our order.  30 more minutes and still no food.  When we finally flagged down our server, she said she would check on it and did not return for another 20 minutes and which point we left.  Terrible service!"
0Y1db779oH2OzSczlAF0Ww,2,"I asked the concierge at my hotel for a local dive that sold good food cheap. This place is not that.  It's a tourist trap with mediocre food and moderate prices.  I should have known when I walked in and saw a gift shop selling Whiskey Joe's tee shirts.  I was hungry and it was traffic hour so I stayed rather than try to find some other place. 

I ordered the blackened grouper and it came out quickly. The first thing I noticed was that it appeared everything was reheated including the fish. The ""fresh steamed"" vegetables were still cold as was the rice. The cold was not room temp, but fridge cold.  I gave the fish a shot and it was just ok. It may have been reheated as well since the blackened portions had no crisp. Overall it was disappointing."
5H5WVi2Glss7UT1Psy6ZDw,3,"Nothing spectacular but just what you want in a cheesy beachside resturant/bar. Alligator heavy decor, lovely view of the water, indoor & outdoor seating, reasonable prices, ok food. We had the gator bites (yum), firecracker shrimp (chewy but liked the sweet & sour sauce), bbq pizza (my boyfriend was a fan, there was a lot of meat on it - pork & bacon) & Caribbean Cobb salad (I loved it - mango, pineapple & fresh jalapeÃ±o in addition to your standard Cobb salad ingredients). Slow but friendly service."
