iTQNM_QR76psmp-yufufwA,4,"Wooow people, just woow.  This place is delicious, personally its comparable to Pappadeux (if you haven't tried it, then try it).  The menu (i forgot to take a picture of) is obviously a majority of seafood but definitely checkout the pictures taken.  The pictures don't even do the food justice though because its not a scratch n' sniff (or taste).  So, the least you can do is take my word for it. First, lets start with the appetizers.  The appetizers we ordered were fried gator bites and a pile of nachos, for my main course I ordered the creamy linguine with blackened fish (grouper i think.). The gator bites were delish, however I don't recommend using the dipping sauce that it comes with because the seasoning on the gator bites plus the sauce seasoning is almost an instant shot of salt straight to the dome.  Instead I just used good ol' regular ketchup.  The sweetness from the ketchup totally offsets the saltiness on the breading.  I didn't get a chance to really taste the nachos because they were demolished within minutes, but trust me the like of nachos is a literal pile!  Because they got demolished so quick, I'll assume they tasted at least great.  Now for the main course, the creamy linguine with blackened fish was probably one of the best I've had in awhile.  The noodles were a little thicker than what I like, but it didn't take away from the how good it tasted.  The prices for their menu items were a kittle up there, but when you eat here I wanna say you're also paying for an amazing view.  Go around sunset, or stay until then... creates a little better ambiance depending on the party that you come with."
hgF5EO-wKcz8DlSzP1ou7Q,4,"Came to Whiskey Joes for lunch. It has great sitting outside on the patio and inside with wide open windows overlooking the ocean. Amazing views and their portion sizes of food are excellent for sharing! 
I ordered their bowl of Spicy Island Gumbo ($8 & large size) and it tasted good and could be a meal if you were looking for a little bit lighter lunch portion. Also ordered the Snapper in Paradise which was at least a 6oz piece of fish topped with tomatoes and sauce that was delicious. It came with two sides and I ordered the broccoli and fries. ($26) Wasn't too fond of the broccoli, needed seasoned and was half way raw. It is slightly higher in price, but know that their portions make up for it and the sizes are worth the price. 
Only other thing that I didn't know is that there is valet parking only in their lot which is $5. 
I didn't get to go on the beach area because it was windy and slightly raining, but looks great and relaxing! Will be back to sit out and relax in the sun!"
lgdwDAfS_P9M-yg0MvmJTg,1,"I want to start saying that I wish I could give no stars. This place is hands down the worst food in all Tampa Bay area. If you want to grab a drink and look at the water, it might be ok.. if you wish to eat something descent (not looking for gourmet food here), please go to Bahama Breeze on the other side of the bay (5 min from this place). My experience started with the hostess being mean to us saying that I would have to wait 1 hour at least to sit outside on a Tuesday afternoon. Ok, we asked to sit inside by the window and even though the tables were empty, including several window ones, they said that it wasn't possible. 

Anyway, we ordered the peel n' shrimp for app and it was okay. Then, we ordered a chopped salad, scallops app and jambalaya. They were all nasty and it felt like they were sitting in the kitchen and then they just brought up to our table. The prices are also not cheap for a bar with mediocre food.

I understand you're on the water and people like coming here for drinks and ""party"", but please serve food that at least taste fine. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone and will not for sure bring friends that visit from out of town ever again."
lfDtvjhnriu3yWBLg1yGSA,1,"Would not recommend as a place for a large group. I had a group of 20 on a Sunday evening, and even though reservation was made more than a week before, service was horrible. Had to hunt down a waitress to take orders from us one hour after the reservation time, and then beg to get our checks at the end. Waitresses stopped by not even once in 3 hours to check up on us. I tipped how much I thought the servers worked for (actually, I thought I was being generous with what I tipped given how little they did), only to face a waitress confronting me at the end with the elusive ""was everything okay? because we live on tips"". LOL. COME ON. I had asked for tables conducive for socializing and even though there were tables in a corner area perfect for the purpose, I was instead given a looong linear table in the middle of the restaurant. Given the perfect location and views they have going on for them, I think they would do sooo much better if they hired the right people to attend on clients. *end of vent*"
jNBViPHOt35KY74tXxrPjA,2,Service is slow. No one approched us and when i grabed a waitress it took forever to get a pitcher of beer.
RLjBFzzBtcHzC6x5YW52QA,3,"We take visitors here when we pick them up at the airport. Nachos are the best. The food is great and the outside seating by the water is pleasant.  I wish they would have a larger menu for beach side, but, you can always eat inside and just hang outside with yummy drinks"
zm0pSrJwv_98A0UY9TGnMA,3,Would be a 4 to 5 star if the wait wasn't as long for the food.  Tastes great. Fun staff amazing view.
JBTTC2P0Kx-uuNo5c4WAtQ,3,"Traveled down to Whiskey Joe's with my wife for lunch. We ordered their Tequila and Garlic dip pen shrimp, and that appetizer had great flavor. We then order the Gumbo for me and the Beer Cheese soup for her. My gumbo had a good flavor but a little runny. Her Beer Cheese had a great flavor but very thin like water. Then I order their Fish and Chips and my wife ordered the Ma hi Fish Tacos. Both dishes look good but... very plain flavor, nothing outstanding about food. The service was top topnotch as well as the view...."
xPZl8X4M8-6_EHu0LFWURQ,2,"I need to make clear the beach bar and the restaurant are two very different experiences. I'll start with the restaurant, the lobby smelled like URINE. Overwhelmingly. The girls bathrooms were lovely, but the boys said the smell definitely was coming from their restroom, and it was repulsive. If I could, negative stars. The only thing safe to order would be bottled beer. And the price would be worth it given the great view. I was in a group of 8 people. Not one rated their food over a 3/10. And we're not hard to please people.
Oysters- The worst oysters hands down. Absolutely zero taste. I ordered 6, ate 2. Wish I'd had none. Nachos- I couldn't even find the cheese until I gave up on eating it and just dug with a fork to find it on the VERY BOTTOM along with some very soggy chips.
Chipotle Cioppino- was sent back. But they didn't charge her. Although I was still charged for my oysters.
Swashbuckler's Basket- 2 orders of this. Probably the most well received of the lot. But still rated a 3/10.
All American Sliders- was requested to come with avocado, not only missing the avocado but also the onions. Was later brought out on the side. My friend ended up eating the patties by themselves just to get the protein because she needed to eat something.
Signature Burger- She said the burger had 0 flavor. Ate the fries which she considered mediocre.
Gumbo- probably the best thing I tasted but crazy salty. Something I have no problem with my friend was not a fan.
The drinks- 2 margaritas and I had some type of lemonade. You will never get drunk here. Both girls that ordered the margaritas ordered a second shot to pour in... By the time I was halfway done with my drink, halfway, it was just water. Not even syrup.
The service- Nah. Wasn't there. The waiter seemed to put in some effort but he was clearly not having a good year. The lack of effort was made very evident though when about 15 or more seagulls attacked a nearby table that hadn't been cleaned off. I swear I'm not making any of this up. This was our experience.

That bar tho...

While still spendy, they were well worth it. Sitting on the beach with that view! And my drink was so unbelievably yummy. I crave it days later. I believe it was The Hurricane Juice that I ordered. It was blended, blue and had coconut milk. It was unbelievable. If you're nearby, and want a tasty drink, game of volleyball, a swim, or corn hole, definitely stop here. Just stay as far away from the main restaurant as possible."
SOT0THlT7xDq-7haI6Ss8Q,3,"Great beach, nice staff. Food and drink is expensive and not very good. Parking is also an issue."
wSGHQk1J64cF3Fkdtj50Ow,1,"Greasy tasteless expensive food. Don't buy into the hype and save your money. We ordered fried grouper sandwich, blackened grouper dinner and jerk chicken sandwich. No flavor except grease."
wxpywz7AMfBwJ-bDY8FqQA,5,Bar on the beach is amazing! Jamaican jerk chicken sandwich was delicious! Drink specials were fruity and sweet. The atmosphere is definitely what makes it!
IUBNQXEakOOMEk21XyD1JQ,4,"You simply cannot beat the views from every seat in this place!  Pull up an outdoor bar stool, watch the sunset and order a frozen margarita or daiquiri with your honey.  Stroll over to the beach or their tiki bar in the sand.

The food is better than average although not gourmet..... fish tacos, beer can chicken, a nice beer cheese bread bowl soup.  

Tequila is great but with the views, music and people at this hopping place it is best to come early and stay all day.  

Be sure to valet park for free but tip those guys - parking is tight here.  Love their little gift shop and space for large parties.  Lots of live music indoors and out - only thing missing is a Sunday brunch- especially with those views..... this used to be called castaways years ago and they were known for their brunch... something to think about Joes..... a great place to bring visiting frineds from out of town for enough space, good food and frozen concoctions!"
DvpfdJDuKFfWnV6occEwQw,4,"Very good Gator bites, and fish tacos. Great location looking over the bay. It was a very good, comfortable environment. Would totally go again next time I'm in Tampa, FL."
nYU3yO-D5OiJG9VvvD-vmg,4,"First time here. Fun of good view of the place. View is very relaxing by the beach, good weather. The only thing is the horrible parking as its always  packed and you have to pay if you park  by the beach. Would  definitely  come back if given a chance."
Tis5ECH2Y2NecuJSEM-a2Q,2,This is such a nice place the location is awesome the set up is super chill however i came to the outside tiki bar to grab lunch ordered the sliders very well done they came out pink so i bit one and returned them because i do not do pink meat. Then again i re ordered them saying please very welll done like cripsy . The girls put in a new order they came out once again cooked the same temperature PINK! I dont know how u can mix up WELL DONE AND RARE!!!! Two very different things. First time here and id only come back to drink and chill....
BOTuVpBkuMoPtS6UbS-BWA,3,"I have been to this establishment several times. The food is decent and the environment is very fun. I would try the scallops with the mango sauce! The prices are a little high, but I guess that's expected right on the water. When the beach is busy it is almost impossible to get a drink on time and the staff is not very friendly. Fun place to visit with a large party, but as for an every day restaurant.... I would not recommend."
OGsFMAj6gJ1w0n5Gqdm4Yg,4,The Coconut Mojito was amazeballs. The food was just pretty good.
JdqyvFButEKgGDlQqyjR1w,3,"Food is just okay, but the location is AMAZING. 

There is a barefoot bar on the beach with sand everywhere. It's right on the water. There's also cozy fireplaces to sit around! Great location."
IOHETizZaE64eSrplLVrHA,1,"Uhhh...tourist trap? Starts on a Sunday with no where to park but valet....sorry not validated.....parking. 45 minute wait for table. Seated and waited about 10-15 minutes before some waitress asked if anyone had served us.....seriously? Ordered the taco salad. The meat was clumped as though packed in a can before dumping onto the salad. The garlic bread was tasty, but a bit stale. When this place says"" family friendly"", they aren't joking. Felt like I was at McDonald's play land. Kids everywhere playing let's have a foot race, and commando raid, while absorbed unconcerned parents confused this place with the park playground. The icing on the cake? Family of 4 whose immigration status is highly suspect. Two little girls who scream like banshees, as loud as possible, at the slightest want gone unsatisfied. Obviously they need special help. Meanwhile the grunting fat father does not even bat an eye at the commotion, and only gets involved when one of them runs towards the bar.
On Sundays this place is LOUD. Add to that the playground for children, the valet cost, the WAY overpriced tourist quality grub, gets no stars (I wish) and no returns. I urge others to find another scenic restaurant."
T5lqrkLj6Ss2WOIB9NY5YA,3,"When we arrived, only option was valet..$5, then we wanted to enjoy outside feet in the sand for a couple drinks and food, went to go out to the tiki where we were stopped for another $5 per person cover charge for the DJ..So $15 before we have The opportunity to give them more $$..we opted to eat inside, must say food was great, our server James was awesome, however won't be back..too many options in our great area where they don't hit you up for money before you get in the door."
08viOztiNYpZ-S4MfusKJw,1,"We were very disappointed with this place, it took 20 minutes for the kids drinks,45 minutes for chips/salsa appetizer to come out!! And it took almost an hour for the food to come out, then it was cold.We didn't complain, service was Horrible we will NOT be com"
Vv6DeH4WvBz-c8gxvdD-yw,5,"Where do I begin. Well after long nights yelping and researching for a good spot for my daddys 51st birthday I came across good ol Whiskey Joes. At first my dad didn't even want to go out but after a few coronas  and getting him all spiffy like as real live goodfella he was ready for a good time and that he had. We started off with frozen Jose Cuervo margaritas and him and my mom with a side shot and our appetizers. It was a party of 16 but just to name a few we had there cheese garlic bread which wasn't to grand, there shrimp scampi that my sister devoured, the wings were deeeeelish and so was the kalamari (so my family said because I don't eat no seafood). Oh and might I ask there mud slides were GREAT. The plates of food were gargantuan but all around the food was good. They had the Ketel One girls there giving our free shots and taking pics with mi papa and he was in heaven. Our waitress was slacking because she could handle such a big party plus three other tables. That was the only down fall I believe with parties of eight or more you should get your own waitress for the night. 

 After all the good times at the table we went to the dance floor to tear it up. There were some crazy characters on the dance floor but that made it all the while fun. I hated the peanuts people got to eat because they were EVERYWHERE! NOT GOOD JUST A MESS. There was even one guy using them as confetti. The dj Short-E was pretty good he had us on the dance floor all night and having my dad like the king of the joint. He shouted out my dad the whole night and got him even more free shots from the vip table. It was the best time I had in a while so if your looking for a family outing but with a jamming good time after, Whiskey Joes is a 20 in my book!!"
GB1OfqRLt9cGHV1_puEOyA,5,"I came here for lunch on a Saturday. The place was packed. Must be over 500 people here. I ordered the Black Bleau Hamburger. It was very good. 

I would recommend it to anyone. I would also recommend my server Sara. She came over to the table several times to check on me and to answer any questions I may have. I will return here in the future and I will ask for her."
3h1O8PpJqblAOpaTNyI0bQ,1,This place is Satan's tourist trap. The food is worse than cat food. The service was a special kind of terrible. It has a great view of the bay though which you get to see such classy things as a woman going to take a piss. Save yourself and stomach and skip this hell hole.
mqtxeafUc3RUlRg3ukUC3w,4,"This would be a full 5 if the prices were just a little bit more reasonable! I also never get my favorite drinks made the same way twice which makes me feel nervous each time I order 

The atmosphere and location is one of a kind and it keeps me returning!"
HaLnMd7MOMkQI8bnqppOYA,3,"Great sunset view, but the food's not bad either.  A past visit left us underwhelmed, but this time we truly enjoyed our meal.  Fresh oysters, a delicious grouper sandwich and a chipotle pasta prepared just as requested.   It's not fine cuisine, but it's not intended to be such.  Relax, drink, eat and enjoy the view."
8V8tPzhkGK6yecuzlThkNA,5,"Been here several times and always good.  Tonight my wife and I took my parents for their first time and had great food and a fantastic server, Margaret E.(Maggie) I believe was her name.  Very sweet and excellent service.  She worked hard and made sure we had everything we needed and drinks were always full.  On the way out she even High Fived my 80 year old dad, that made his day.  Thank you Maggie!"
3_NL9FiRps6Q0ocPfaW9OQ,3,Went here for dinner on a Monday night while on a business trip. Nice atmosphere and our waitress was pleasant. Self parking options are limited unless your willing to circle the lot until someone leaves. Toll beach parking is close or valet.
sYc6FPcZtkwF1rZFUr0ryQ,4,"Great sunsets from the out door bar! .... but 
food is average at best especially for the prices as your def paying for waterfront atmosphere . Will go back next time in town ..."
SAVL1kvlTtSYYpBwBPzOQg,3,"Went in for lunch around 2 & I ordered a burger, my friend got a grouper sandwhich. Food was very bland. About as much as I'd expect from a beach restaurant. The drinks were most likely made from syrups, not fresh fruits. I ordered a wild berry mojito that was supposed to have fresh berries on top or muddled in (not sure) but it had a cherry on top (The kind that stay preserved in jars for years and years to come). 
 Servers didn't seem to care, but ours did a good job so that was fine. 
We had to take the handicap ramp out because I had a stroller, servers sleeping in back room on the way out. Friendly chef on the outside of door, but he was smoking - So all in all 3 stars. Not bad, not great."
Vj_PtHManwz2sMmAKeg96g,4,"This place was great. Great views over the water from almost everywhere in the restaurant. I ordered the Maui tacos and they were delicious. Another person in my group order the fish and they stated it was amazing. The service was great and the staff was extremely friendly. I did pay with a credit card and they do not have a machine, so they had to make a carbon copy (old school paper way). I was shocked with that, but food was great and I would come back here to have some drinks and enjoy the view of the water."
F04DzjRFlSQObFX8dHT6dg,4,4.5 stars really! This is a great place to eat and drink on Tampa Bay. Sitting on the deck with a cool breeze and a stiff drink this becomes one of the places where you forget your worries for a few!They may just have one of the best locations on Tampa Bay for the view and with the out side deck and all the giant windows weather you are outside enjoying the breeze or inside to beat the heat you have great views of the water. The food is good but I feel the menu is a little limited which is why I gave 4.5 instead of 5. A little pricey but not too bad.
I0a6enrOCFR0slingUCL5g,2,"I decided to try this place with some friends and we came out disappointed. The calamari and fried alligator came out soggy instead of hot and crunchy. There wasn't much flavor to the appetizers. 

We shared 3 entrees: gumbo, jambalaya, and seafood mac&cheese. The gumbo lacked in the seafood flavor. The jambalaya was average. The seafood mac&cheese was a disappointment. For $20, I expected for different types of shellfish in my mac&cheese. However, all I got was a plate of mac&cheese with tiny bits of shrimp mixed inside.

The service was okay but a tad bit slow. Our waitress checked on us once but never refilled our waters until we had to flag her down & ask for a refill.

The one thing that was enjoyable was the view of the ocean we had at our table."
sZuIQFwdhglj8CDPV8kHlg,2,"Great view, location. Food was mediocre at best. Ordered signature tequila garlic shrimp appetizer- it was not very good....tiny and very few shrimp. The grouper entree came out cold and was small for the price. Net not a repeat for a meal, but a drink at sunset is a maybe."
GeuYaVG5qmmJLu6pOe59PQ,2,"OK place.....views are GREAT......service not so much.  Bartenders need lots of help in acknowledging those at the bar.....let alone the dinner table orders from their waitstaff!  One blonde behind the bar was rude, in the way of other bar staff, and slow.  Should be fired, or at least relegated to the kitchen.  Can't work in a busy environment.  Sad.....could be a Great place!!"
JMNJpYg45SFsxK1SELOWtw,4,"Ok so this has become one of my favorite spots in town the garlic par wings are too die for, they have a really great vibe both inside and outside at the beach bar their loaded sweet potato fries are  awesome all around great time the service could use a lil improvement out at the beach bar ."
9XK2OjpDEa__A-JE3g1hpg,5,So me and my fiancé chose to come here because it was on the water. We brought the baby with us. I had read other Yelp reviews and they weren't that positive. But we gave it a try anyways. Upon getting there we weren't even greeted by a server once sat. But our server JAMIE made up for it all. She was first class and made sure we had everything we needed. Constantly checked back and took it to another level. I highly recommend her and any of her sections. She knows what it means to give good service. It's servers like this who make up for others mistakes. She made me and my family's experience memorable and us want to come back again. Great queso dip and pretty decent food. A must for anyone who wants to be by the ocean and enjoy some food and drinks!
bHQLbkSRfazwOpT4ivThTQ,2,I was not happy at all. I'm a foodie so I'll give anything a try. I should have know to turn away based off the other reviews. I'm in town for the weekend and my hotel is next door. I went to whisky joes and was served soggy fried fish. Not only was my fish was soggy but so was my friends. We order the Jamaican White fish. The batter wasn't cooked all the way.  Our server was polite. I can't fault him for the cooks action but for that they are getting 2 stars.
RtKZI1AY5GCXibiJDU3gpw,2,"Parking is non existent and painful to maneuver after rejection - the lot is so ill conceived that we sat in a line of vehicles just trying to leave. Once in, the band plays outside (brilliant in Florida summer weather) and the service was ridiculously bad. When someone DID finally stop to take our order, they had attitude. Finally went to the bar when I wanted a water refill...the water is self serve out of a bar top machine. Except..it was empty! And no one behind the bar cared once we got their attention. The food was horrible. I ordered what I thought was shrimp and it came out in a bowl. It looked like shrimp soup. I was told ""oh, it's a dipping sauce"" what? Ick. My husbands burger was dry...and he couldn't get service at the bar either. When I asked for a to-go box, the server sighed mightily and told me she'd have to go inside for that. 15 mins later, I saw her trudging up the walkway for said box. Needless to say, I will never go there again and my shrimp soup ended up in the garbage. Even the dog didn't want it."
Bg5GkpAntCU9xMqlgmpjig,2,"It was very astounding situation at the front desk that we stepped in and they just looked at us without saying 'Hi'. The hostess looked at my face and stayed quiet for seconds. I couldn't stand being awkward,therefore, I started saying Hi to her.. No response once again.. So I said We are a party of four, now yes, 'follow me..'. 

Food was literally mediocre. Just a seafood restaurant by the beach. Table service was just slightly different from the hostess. Only thing we're impressed is the atmosphere by the beach.

Sad to say Being respectful should be the basis for the good human being. Hopefully, you just forgot NOT be on purpose. Otherwise,  :-("
E25FVF87m1wxTrSoKEf_Mg,4,"Whiskey Joe's has great views of the Bay and is only a couple of minutes from the airport.  Its very popular with my coworkers for happy hour, but tourists will also enjoy the relaxed atmosphere and views.  The food is fairly good. I'm a fan of their nachos, fried calamari (that includes breaded and fried green and red peppers) and the cocount shrimp.  

Whiskey Joe's is located right on the Causeway and the drive over the Causeway is one of my favorite. I highly recommend this place for locals and tourists alike."
O-kjEMoTsdVISmvSBJWhGQ,4,"Parking is rough but they have valet which makes it easier.  It's crazy busy on the weekends.  My favorite time was a random Monday afternoon and just sitting outside for a bit with the water made my day.  The drinks aren't anything special, but hey the ambience is quite nice when it's not crowded. It makes me feel like I'm on vacation! Water, warm sand, and tiki huts is all I need!"
gEuJjhv1CcD3i4Nk70Hb-A,1,"Bathroom filthy, I wonder what the kitchen looks like? Our group had steak tacos-bad, Mac & cheese w crab & shrimp, couldn't eat it, waitress told us ""don't order that"" we should have listened! Burgers over cooked. For 7 meals no drinks paid $160. Not incl. Tip"
RwIgGdve4XEGo6iIfcC7IA,4,Good bar food!! Great location with outdoor seating and water views! Pricing is great too for the amount of food you get!
AHDUWm0-5zWDH9Ko1HngCw,4,"the wait staff is friendly and efficient. I ordered mussels that had the best taste, but half weren't opened, the waitress immediately took them back and placed a second order, there was only one closed and I didn't mind because the sauce they are in is fantastic. I ordered the steak tacos and they were pretty bland, even with all the toppings on it....it was a bit pricey at $11.99 for two soft shell tacos....my bill was $31 for mussels, two tacos and a $5 beer....but it was my date night with myself"
VbtuSjPLcc_Attfu9-knVQ,5,An absolute gem in Tampa. Premiere piece of real estate. Stunning views and the area on the sand is great. We had the mahi mahi bites. They were delicious. I wish it was a little warmer when we went. Defenetly would be back. Service was friendly and fast.
JZlBbHnatlH_WK3R6GjlAA,5,"Love it. Me and my friend went there for lunch. We got a very nice seat outside right next to the water. There were a lot of food. I could only finish one taco and take the other home. Staffs are super friendly. Thank you to our server, Tiffany. However, I don't like they only have valet parking."
TzEFkNUFU_sqUZTvbv_goQ,5,The food is AMAZING !!!!!!! If you want fresh and i mean fresh sea food then this is the place that you need to come.
rzkTBOduKTSdmR63Aa-xew,1,Dirty... And just needs a total makeover.. service was horrible... Bartenders were rude and had no customer service skills..
1mH7lzLe8GreZF5D8A87Kg,3,"I came here this past summer with a local friend while working in Tampa for the week. The location is great - we had a table with a view of the water and then ventured to the outdoor tiki bar after dinner. The service was good, nothing over the top but good. The food was the same - good, no complaints. I had the coconut shrimp as an app and then the shrimp and crab louie salad for my dinner. The salad was loaded with ingredients that all went well together. I would come back here again if I were in Tampa. Nothing stood out besides the location, but nothing was bad either."
aOKNcA6PxsRaGYKO21h3og,2,"First time here, I arrived before the rest of my party. I decided to grab a seat at the inside bar while I waited. My first impression is that this place is not cleaned properly.  I chose a seat near the beer taps. There were fruit flies all over the place- all over the tap drains, the alcohol bottles,my personal space. The bar was sticky and you could smell the stale alcohol. Not up to my standards of cleanliness."
ry1ViN57pCGIVdTAVi3a0g,3,"On a Saturday evening this is a busy place with limited parking and average food. You can pay $5 for valet parking or leave your car in the beach park next door.  On entering for dinner, the bar is crowded and the restaurant is noisy. For appetizers the onion rings were good; the steamed mussels were average (the cooks left 4 unopened ones in the serving, instead of just placing opened ones in the serving dish). The scallop salad was ok. The macaroni and cheese was creamy & had a cheesy flavor but was bland/boring.  The fish sandwich was not very tasty and came on a large sesame-seed hamburger bun that was not toasted. Drinks did not seem to have much booze. The margaritas on the rocks were half ice cubes.  The staff were friendly and the food came to the table in a short time.  We felt the drink prices were too high and the chef should pay attention to making the food more flavorful.  On the positive side-there was a parrot head event outside at the restaurant."
G6_9UuxXkVcWppdfHRcH6w,2,"This would have to be one of the most disappointing lunches. I read reviews and thought it sounded good so headed over before flying out. Food was not good, pizza tasted like a frozen pizza, blackened grouper tacos tasted undercooked and really no flavor, not sure what happened to the blackened fish. I would save my money next time and skip this place. Nothing about it impressed me. Too many other great spots in and around Tampa area. Sorry!"
mTOCi39L_szcVidhs9EBQg,3,"The food is just okay here...nothing to really write about.  The scallops were over cooked and the raw oysters were borderline (I should have known it to order it because it's not in season but being spoiled in Boston I thought it would be okay to order...thank God I didn't get sick.  

The view is absolutely beautiful.  The ambiance and bar is good too."
UygApAl4-3Jm6Qj2rCfCEw,5,"Marty the GM was gracious enough to contact me, and explain that the parking problem we experienced was a SNAFU caused by a county employee, and that it will never happen again.  He also sent a very nice letter of apology to our friends who were with us, celebrating a birthday.  And, he sent us gift certificates for our next dinner.

My wife and I regularly dine out.   Most restaurants don't respond to bad reviews because they don't care.  Whiskey Joe's does care about their patrons and their reputation, and made things right by us, and our friends.


Hats off!  We will be back."
mwf7kKwGL0WvUeG0M9CsWA,5,"Typical on waterfront  bar, huge place with outdoor seating and ALOT of indoor seating.. Oddly great service, didn't expect the attentiveness we got.. Great place next to ben t davis beach.. Mixed crowd with older folks, tourists and ""locals"".."
AwVB_CveBk905qAgT3ojyA,3,"Solid 3.5.. Place was packed & right on the beach. Sat on the deck looking over the bay. 

Blackened Grouper sandwich was excellent but the fries were just ok. Probably frozen and refried. 

Staff was awesome.. Very friendly and attentive..
Loved the beach motif and the atmosphere .."
bNDYtQ9JDSScXv-bbq6d_g,1,"Bring Your Own Fish

Stopped in for some ""Famous FishTacos""  after we picked my mom up from TPA for quick lunch and was super disported .  We all ordered the 3 fish tacos $15  which had very little to almost NO fish in them and little flavor.
My poor mom got the least and I felt bad as I was the one who picked the place!  The only bright spot in the whole experience was our server who was great. SKIP THIS PLACE"
RwD5I8eyMyr8s6drOWm_dg,5,"Can't beat the view or key lime pie!  Ask for Frank, he was a fantastic server.  As it was my first time he guided me through the menu and had excellent spot on recommendations.  Impeccable service.  Get a table on deck, can't get much more relaxed then this!"
#NAME?,3,Its on the water.  The food was ok and the staff was ok.  There wasn't anything that stuck out and would bring me back again.  I didn't think the waiter was concerned with our table at all.  Our drinks didn't get filled our whole meal.  Scenery is nice. Meeeeh. Ok.
otgJoma_5G5w2W_7cIcHnw,3,"Came to Whiskey Joe's on a Tuesday night for dinner with some work colleagues.  The view out on to the water is incredible, the decor within the restaurant is nice, and the service was very good.  The bar looked like a good place to hang out as well for drinks if you weren't in for dinner.  We started with the spinach, artichoke, and crab dip, then I had the fish tacos (baja-style) for dinner.  The dip was served with chips and was good.  The fish tacos were also pretty tasty, though not what I would call true baja-style, it's probably more accurate to describe it as ""baja-style-like.""  There was a decent beer and tropical drink list as well.  All in all, I would definitely give this place a solid 3 to 3.5 stars...a good place for dinner and drinks with an awesome view."
z_68kPydR1ZdSnRbfRsamw,4,"If you are from out of town and visiting Tampa, this would probably be the perfect place to stop by for drinks on the beach. It is convenient and not too far from hotels and has a parking lot. There is live music or a dj, an outside bar and fire pits. The beach-y vibes are definitely at a full 100 here. If you go for dinner or later, the sunset and views are pretty nice.

I was here on a work trip with about 30 people so we went outside to the beach area where there were tons of open tables. There are waitresses who will come to the tables and take your orders but there is also a bar where you can just go up and order your food and drinks. They were not staffed very well for tons of orders on the beach the night we came but our waitress was very fast and friendly. I would definitely give her props for how many orders she had to take and deliver.

The drinks here are pretty sweet. I would not recommend any of the margaritas or mixed drinks from the menu if you do not like sweet drinks. They are border line too sweet and will probably make you sick if you have too many. With that being said, they tasted good and you could definitely tell they had alcohol in them.

We ordered many appetizers and a few entrees. The food is not high quality but it does the job. I would say casual family dinner / bar food quality. If you want to try alligator they have gator bites which are fried and taste like chicken."
C-PSqBHuPlvCLXWkMovnuw,2,"I was less than impressed here tonight. The ambience and scenery is great. The food is mediocre at best, and the service wasn't my favorite. 

I ordered the grilled mahi with shrimp bertie. I have a gluten allergy and let the waitress know. I cannot eat grains currently (medical issue), and requested a side of collard greens instead of the jasmine rice. The waitress seemed very uncomfortable with this request even though I stated I was ok with paying the full amount for the additional side since they don't do substitutions. This didn't seem to sit well with her, so I just accepted her offer of double veggies because I didn't feel like arguing about it. 

A few minutes later, the waitress told me the sauce would be on the side since it has gluten in it. I would expect that in 2014 - in an area like Tampa - servers and chefs would be cognizant enough of the fact that putting a sauce on the side on my dish that contains an ingredient I'm allergic to is a ridiculous idea. Why would I want a sauce that is going to make me sick for 2 weeks to be brought out with my meal‽ I politely requested the sauce be left out altogether. 

The mahi was dry and overcooked. The shrimp on top were small and unimpressive. For $20.99, there should've been Gulf shrimp on this dish, not the tiny shrimp they serve at Panera. 

It's too bad because the venue looks great. But the servers need to be educated, and the food could use a serious upgrade. 

Sit on the deck and enjoy a couple of drinks. Eat elsewhere."
Fkgvr9O48yfhQLbp6m9V6Q,1,"Whiskey Joes is TERRIBLE! place smells like everyone and everything pissed all over everything. Even mentioned it to the hostess. They say it always does and people quit their job there because of the filth. Food was some of the worst served in a restaurant. Mcdonalds puts this place to shame. Service is a joke. I will tell everyone how horrible this place is.. Way over priced.. Warm beer, bread served half warm/half cold. All Sysco crap food.. Place sucks!"
5dNj1KhZQOZwhl7MP9liyA,4,"So, check it out, from outside, I thought, typical tourist chain - when I got inside, that was exactly what it was.
But, great points: not-so-typical-fare like gator cakes, and gator bites. Great seafood gumbo, and the service was on point.
Live reggae music on Sunday night and a gift shop for t shirts and hats and such.
Honestly, the bartender rocked and the food was good. The mussels were good enough for me to eat all of them and not regret one morsel.
It's a fun place if you happen to be in Tampa and have nothing else to do."
2BwjXw50Ad2BzGanNk3V5A,4,"We've been wanting to go to this place for a few weeks. We're very new to the area and decided to try it out the other day. It was pretty slammed there. They actually have valet parking. I'm not sure, but making a reservation is possible. We started off at the bar, but ended up moving outside. We ordered the whiskey pepper dippin shrimp (I had them put the gross feta on the side) and it was by far the most delicious shrimp dish I've had...maybe ever! 
My fella ordered the grouper with rice, broccoli, and got a GIANT Cobb salad (he had them bring out the salad first). The salad was amazing (juicy grilled chicken, bacon, mangos, and more) and could be an actual entree (without blue cheese, please). I got the fish (pollock) and chips. The seasoning on the fries was yummy and the fish was well-flavored. I will say we probably won't order all this food next time. We were wicked full after inhaling the app and salad. We had some full to-go boxes. Even though it was very busy, our service was solid and waitress was efficient. We'll go back again and try other stuff :)"
SJ_UGwv5UY825TWjV19Qbg,2,"We tried to order food from one of the tables in the sand (beach area), but the waitress did not return. So after waiting around an hour we decided to head up to the deck area.  The view from the deck was totally awesome!  Wait staff was friendly enough. 

Food was average, but I'd go again to relax and enjoy the view!"
5gJ8goa6K9gayG6zyYb2Zg,5,"Location, location, location (and wonderful menu and outstanding service).  I visited Whiskey Joe's to meet 2 local attorneys when first arriving to Tampa.  Close to the airport, but you are immediately on the water and white beach sand.  Calamari and other appetizers were outstanding.  Staff very friendly. There is an outdoor beach bar setting on the sand as wells as restaurant/ patio seating.  This is the experience I was looking for from a Florida restaurant!  We spent 4 more days in the general area... Whiskey Joe's was the best!"
5AOeK-bch7Xj43Vl_ky0UA,5,We come down to Whiskey Joe's every year for Music on The Bay. For the last 2 years we have nothing but amazing service outside from Amanda P. The best server you have!! She never gets an order wrong and always has a smile on her face. Attentive and a wonderful person!! This year we also had the pleasure to have Felicia as our server one evening. Wonderful as well!! We will see them again next year if not before!!
QV2W3YVokEVFT8JyQFrLKg,5,"This place is like a mini vacation.  My work is by here, so some of my co-workers and I decided to get together for Happy Hour on Friday and relax on Whiskey Joe's beach.  Great idea!  They have great Happy Hour specials, an awesome view, really good service (even on the beach), and great food!  Their Joe's Nachos and chilled peel and eat shrimp apps were so good, and HUGE. Our server was very nice, attentive and patient even though she was clearly very busy.  

Will definitely be going back here a lot more!"
xGEPyay_F2H2ZAhIgi_uig,2,"Great view. But mediocre food and experience. Our server was nice, but food came out cold, was super expensive for quality that well, was not that great. I mean I ordered chips and queso as an appetizer and the cheese and chips were cold. It's more of a place to pull up with your boat and drink. Or go and enjoy the outside beach and patio and have a couple adult beverages than actually enjoying a meal. Oh, and parking is a disaster, the valet lets in people in the lot at his random discretion. No method to the madness."
KTxhi3JCeDSjfnv3GseOkw,3,"Great location! Good Drinks! Good Food! Maybe we were there on a bad waitstaff day, cuz that's rhe only reason why I can't give 5 starts.  The waitress 
/waiters can make or break the visit."
2U9ZNzZbqaCa5eYeL89LDQ,2,"Terrible place. Dirty and trashy. Poor service and I would go if you're looking to eat. That said, if you want to get drunk around a bunch of trashy other drunks. Come on in"
zlhrAJgBXXJWvhRphxIiMg,1,"Seriously dissapointed.
We were trying to show our friends from out of town a good time by enjoying the sunset on the water. Our first attempt there will be our last. Valet sign said parking lot was full we were directed to only find parking on the beach. We waited a few minutes and numerous parties left, allowing spots to free up. But were still told to find spots on the beach, half of our party waited out front while the other half drove around to find parking. In doing so, valet took the next 3 cars immediately. After seeing that we directed our car to come back and took our large party else where. Extremely dissapointing and bad customer service overall."
kZaeCydgzR8JDc6nHhricA,1,"I went to Whiskey Joe's For a meet up event on April 28th... we arrived early for dinner at 18:45. There was a ""band"" playing at 21:00 so we arrived early enough for dinner so as not to have to pay a cover charge to eat. As ridiculous as it sounds even at 18:45 they were insisting on a $10 per person cover charge. If we had not been meeting others later we would have left. The evening began on a sour note with the cover charge... and continued with mediocre food and poor service by the very slow moving waitstaff. 
     The ""band"" that ""played"" was singularly bad. I high school pick up band would have played better since they actually play their own instruments. This band for all intents and purpose looked to be mailing it in and lip syncing. Clearly not worth any cover charge let alone the $10 per person they charged.
Yes, I realize that I was already biased by the cover charge but poor service is poor service. I will never patronize this place again despite it's wonderful location."
2Rg1lyBo9mVSmMjHUop3WQ,4,"Stopped by Sunday January 21.  Hubby recommended after finding accidentally on a trip to Tampa several months ago.  While the parking lot, the tiki bar, the outside deck and the inside bar were packed and lively, we enjoyed a more relaxed, quiet spot in the dining room.  Sat at window overlooking the Bay watching our Jacksonville Jaguars (sadly) lose to New England as the sun set in all its glory.  We started with Gator Bites - best use for any gator.  Tasty.  Hubby ordered Shrimp and Grits.  He says they were some of the best he's ever had.  Seasoned very well with nine large shrimp.  I ordered the Snapper grilled substituting cheesy grits for the rice.  Snapper was moist and also nicely seasoned.  Came with two beans and carrots as the veg.  Yummy all around.  Rounded dinner out with two Whisky Joe's beers (a red snd a blond) which we liked a lot too.  Sum up:  Hubby was right to recommend.  Atmosphere choices for everyone.  Stay off the deck if you want a quieter dinner.  Bring yiyr bathing suit to eat, drink and play on the sand at the tiki bar.  Bring $5 cash for valet parking - worth it.  Nice employees too."
KGnFVSUPYax5o-HxiLNvzA,4,"Great food with an awesome atmosphere. The service left something to be desired, and they let some lady in to sell candles for charity, which is very weird. You really don't want to be pressured into buying a candle for someone with cancer at dinner. All things considered, a decent place to visit but with so many other choices, I would probably check out some other place on my next trip."
Z-H_7f-28Drm49Flmxyrsw,5,"Today was my long awaited college graduation. go Bulls! I reserved space at Whiskey Joes for our celebration. This place has never let me down!! Joanne, the manager, was so accommodating to us. The food is wonderful and wait staff are very attentive- even though we were a party of 20+ with all separate checks! You're missing out if you haven't been!"
ueWrn0jGC98hyoB3laBY1A,1,"The only redeeming quality of this establishment is its location, do not eat here. The odor when you walk in is overwhelming and should have been my cue to leave but I had friends in town that wanted to be on the water...The service is good, aside from the significant overuse of ""ya'll "". Food: fish tacos, I ""upgraded"" to grouper (something I don't really understand, just have grouper on your menu) I spit it out in my napkin...  I haven't done that since I was a child!!! I don't know what that was but it wasn't grouper!  I apologize for graphic visual but the food here is not good."
7XYd04zxFmrGxfFhX_ylKA,3,I was here for a Trop Rock fundraiser and ate inside the restaurant. They weren't very busy inside but the service was very slow. It took forever to get our drinks. I had the beer battered grouper sandwich and my boyfriend had the shrimp tacos. The food was pretty good and the servings were large.
fJYOLgkujw5LxeeUgwkEow,5,"This place is wonderful! Excellent service. The hostesses were nice and our server was attentive. We got the fish tacos and hamburger sliders - both were great. 

THE VIEW was BEAUTIFUL!!! We didn't want to wait to sit outside (it's a Friday night and there was a 30 min wait) so we sat inside and every table had a great view of the bay. It wasn't overly noisy, perfect for our little one. Inside there was plenty of space and the tables weren't all crammed close together.

Overall good food, great service, and beautiful views of the bay. I'm so glad we stopped by for our visit to Tampa!

Also, there's plenty of parking at the beach right next to Whiskey Joes. Only costed $1. It was worth it parking there and walking a short way to the restaurant."
P0yn6ljHanh07h9XyOSgAg,1,"Hulk Hogan's restaurant. Dreadful food and service, plus the sleaze of association with Hulk Hogan. Parking is a nightmare too. Why waste a single penny here when there are so many other options in Tampa."
HZTHfeIzDTrfbiwVXSuM3g,5,"Came here for dinner when I was visiting Tampa with my parents. We all got different types of food (salad, wrap, tacos, burger) and it was all cooked perfectly and they give good portions too!"
Er4YT5O2i9M69E80pNgyFg,4,"Great time at Music on the Bay. Our server, Ashley S, literally ran her butt off for us, keeping us happy."
SfkVnjpKSrlhnfs8zw0vbQ,4,"We came to Whiskey Joe's expecting nothing but a good time, fun drinks and some appetizers. We sat in front of the large window looking over the water and people outside having fun. The view alone made me a fan. 

We ordered up three appetizers as our lunch, the half dozen oysters, the spicy shrimp and toast and the mussels appetizer. Each dish was good. I think the mussels were my favorite, although I am a sucker for oysters.

I ordered a Rum Runner and my guy went for a iced tequila shot and a Corona. We were celebrating the end of his business trip and the start of a fun vacation day together.

I enjoyed the hot sauce that they offer, it's actually got some heat to it. I would have bought it, but I didn't see it in the gift shop."
VKS5NlWCz6oHJbvzrrGg5A,2,"Deep fried everything!   A real grease pit.  Nice location on the bay, but that's about it. Service was acceptable, but nothing special."
pLv6SnVzlL9FFRxIpvS3Gg,2,"I got the chicken wings they were so chewy. It's a shame because the breading and sauce were pretty good. You could tell they were frozen. The fries were the best part of the meal. People I came with got mahi mahi and grouper sandwich. They said it tasted all right. Definitely not worth it for the price. Seems like more of a touristy spot, so if all you're interested in is mediocre food and atmosphere this is your place."
bLPINthln7rtGQh3jsgSXg,1,This place is terrible.  The food is bad. The alcoholic beverages have no alcohol in them but they charge you top self prices.  The view of the bay is beautiful but that's about it.
UxadKsq-FxAgw9X7MXAinw,2,"As others have said this place is a tourist attraction, especially with the gift shop. Starting with the atmosphere the Tiki-ish theme is cute and fitting for the area. The view is by far the best part about this place b/c the food was NASTY! 

Over priced for what was served, lacking quality and very poor presentation. The ""gator bits"" were gross, very rubbery, cold, under cooked, and over breaded. 

See pic of the remainder of my cheeseburger sliders for a good idea of what to expect. Yes I ate them b/c I was starving and they had good flavored beef, but there were so many things wrong with the entire dish. Little over cooked teaspoons of beef with american cheese on top placed on toasted tablespoon size wrinkled up sweet rolls is what arrived to the table. No vegetables on them, probably b/c that wouldn't all fit on the mini size slider rolls with the teaspoons of beef. The four ""sliders"" were surrounded by a boat load of crispy fries. The golden arches would have been a better choice for me. 

The drinks were decent but the view will be the only reason I would ever go back there. Service = 3, Food = 1, Atmosphere = 3, Location and view = 4."

5fLGdlLHPwZaAm0m2VQTKA,5,"Oh Whiskey Joe's how I love thee, let me count the ways! First, let me go back to the beginning. After flying all morning, a few of my travel partners and I decided to take advantage of our 4 hour layover and experience Tampa! Well, we really just needed a drink after the crazy past few days.  So in googling bars close 
to the airport, we found Whiskey Joe's!  Once we figured out how to escape the Tampa International Airport (that place is crazy), we hopped in an Uber and made it just before 11am.  The young ladies who greeted us were extremely welcoming and sat us on the outdoor patio where we met the greatest server EVER, Frank!!! He walks up to this group of ladies and says, ""We must be celebrating something if we left the men at home!"" With a little shimmy and shake! Frank was a riot and such a gentleman! When we expressed that we were in a time crunch, he effectively got our orders in and even got our checks to us early so that we could pay and dash!  NOW: on the food. Lord have mercy!  Have you ever..I mean ever had a sweet potato waffle fry?! Well these were sweet potato waffle fries on crack. Bacon, BBQ pulled pork with a savory cheese sauce, good enough to make you smack your momma (sorry Mom if you're reading this)!  We also had the Thai chili wings which were tasty, the American sliders and an assortment of drinks, ranging from The buzzkill to Vice City. There were no complaints.  The only issue was a renegade bee that was hell bent on ruining our outing but the gallant and noble Frank came to our rescue, yielding a towel which he used to chase the perpetrator away.  This was an amazing mini excursion that has sparked a desire to visit Tampa soon for more drinks, more delicious food, exceptional service and some beach time! If you get a chance, check this place out and ASK FOR FRANK!!"
Smk7ZO0ReDUuL5wRLQizZQ,1,"We've been here several times. In the last several months the service has been lacking and inattentive. Regardless of how busy they are, you have to be the one to initiate the service and you are often disregarded for over 15 minutes. We were waiting for over 10 minutes without any service at all before we decided to leave and take our party of 6 somewhere else that can provide good service and good food."
lWkP36tId1VBrGrFAyC-VQ,4,"This was my first time here and  Lily gave excellent service! They advertised on fb that happy hour was everyday 4-7. That was not the case, it is only on weekdays. Lily went above and beyond to accommodate is and definitely is the reason that I will be back!"
gP8QcQZ2n7EyTAMCYKaNvQ,5,"Great comfort food not the healthiest, but hey, go back to  your diet Monday! ask for Issy cool waiter, will make the experience that much better, I was hungover from the night before and got a banana to help ease my tummy.  Lol. great views of the bay, can always go next door afterwards seat at the beach and have another cocktail while listening to live music and bonfire right on the beach! Cheers enjoy."
g6PGGxEhw3yiLuDXHkEgwg,1,"Rough night.  The restaurant lost their system, which is bad.  But the management seemed to do nothing, electing to put the staff on the spot to figure out how to do tickets and get paid.  We had a leisurely meal and then another 100+ minutes of waiting on the check.  Just like all the tables around us.

Since I didn't want to penalize our wait staff, I've decided to pull down the reviews.  This one is on the management staff."
fGjVtA2BGFh7iRXHoioriQ,4,"Stopped in at this place while on vacation in Tampa from NYC two weeks ago. The (now ex) girlfriend did a random search for restaurants in the area & we decided on Whiskey Joes. 

The atmosphere was awesome, we ate outside & it was 75 at night in February on the water. We had Marshall as our server. He did an awesome job & was attentive to any allergies or changes we asked to make on our orders. 

The food was awesome. I suggest you try the fried alligator & the awesome choice of drinks they had. The grouper tacos were great too. Only thing is this spot was a little pricey for Tampa I feel, or it would've gotten a higher rating. It's a 3.5-4 from me. Best part though is it's literally ON the water, & they have a cool beach bar with firepits & live music. 

Try it though, you'll like it!"
iJZJxLhiamiwrl_nSVPqxA,4,"i will not give a 5 to any place i have only visited once, but this is a place i could see giving a 5 to in the future after more visits.  great view of the water, service was fantastic, and the food was great.  i had the run and coconut glazed beer battered chicken and it was fantastic.  

i ordered chips and queso as well, which being from Texas i am not used to having to pay for, but if that is my only complaint talk about first world problems."
UZt1hBcbTsfgD0SlFkwB7g,2,"with this place its really about local. great views,on the beach awesome! beautiful actually! everything is perfect even the hut-bar on the beach.the service was amazing,the prices werent bad but the food was.pre frozen crap that taste like the grill is dirty,i will be back for drinks only:)
important UPDATE!
if you buy drinks inside the resteraunt cause the bartender outside at the bar upstairs leaves for a halk hour at a time,she will see that beer,think someone gave it to you cause its not on your bill and double charge for it!!!!! seriously! you know what its like argueing about a bill when drunk! and trying to explain? and it makes you feel like a shithead cause they think youre lying? seriously? whos gonna lie about a few fkn miller lights after excess spending anyway? yikes."
sRG7MQZBHyFHtrG4D3w52g,4,"Good shredded pork sandwich, but no lunch pricing. It's all about the ocean view and people enjoying the beach while you sit in a/c comfort."
--2KOIf3Rg7qDqpaYVszbQ,1,"Great view, thats it. Entire table was sticky.Took 10 mins to even have someone come to our table for drink orders. None of the servers knew where any of the tables were-we literally watched our app go to each of the 8 tables before it finally hit ours. The food was WAY over salted. Our refills took forever and when asked about a beer i ordered and never recieved to be removed from our bill, the server said ""Well, its over on the bar"", as if i should have gotten it myself. 
Never again."
F6EI1q4dfNE0CZQCzySKvA,4,"This place is cool because of the location and boat access.  They have Deepwater between five and 7 feet with a marked channel coming into the restaurant. You can put your boat right on the beach and hang out while drinking or playing. A lot of people put lounge chairs in the water and enjoy and live music or DJ. 

We have not actually eaten their food yet but checked it out for a few minutes for future reference."
1zqIzqXmLj31WmVxOTRe7A,2,"Well. The food is not good at all. The clam chowder was cold and tasted flat out disgusting. The pulled pork sandwich was soggy, fell apart and was made very poorly. People next to me were complaining about the oysters. The bartenders were friendly. The Bloody Mary was delicious and the view is fantastic. The beer was all flat and tasted like the lines hadnt been clean. Don't think I'll be coming back, too many negatives. I honestly got the vibe that no one was in charge and people working just didn't care."
g_J6f2yvW44_aakEZ3_T4Q,2,"Went to Whiskey Joes with a pretty big group... about 15... the ambiance was pretty good... nice area... next to the beach area on the northern part of Tampa Bay... 
Selection of food was OK... The mussels were pretty good... gator bites were kind of salty... and garlic cheese bread got hard right away... 
a couple friends we were with were vegetarians and asked for a vegetarian pizza and nachos without any beef in it... when they got the orders, pizza was brought how it was asked but nachos initially didn't have any visible beef on it till our friend got to the bottom area... he had a couple of us try it because initially we suggested that it might just be re fried beans... but soon enough, we came to the conclusion that there really was beef in it along with the re fried beans... needless to say our group wasn't too happy about it... we gave it back to the waitress's was pretty polite and apologetic about it)... 5 mins after she took it, a supervisor (i'm guessing, he seemed like he was a supervisor or manager type) came over and apologized and said that our friend would get some nachos to go.. our friend said that it wasn't necessary... but soon enough some nachos came in a to go box... we opened it up because the nacho chips were falling out of it on the side of the box... and guess what we found in it, right smack on top... beef... mind you, my friend is a vegetarian and asked to have no meat/beef in his nachos in the first place and thus how we came to the situation... at that point we all just started joking around about it because it was kind of like an FML moment... the waitress once again came back apologetic, although this time she said it was the cooks fault... which we could see that... after that we asked for our checks... i left early with 2 other people and the rest of the group stayed but went on the beach area for drinks... 

attention to detail for specific needs is lacking... what if the person was allergic to beef? or even to another food item for that matter... that could have had serious consequences... when a person says that they don't want a certain thing in the dish, i think that it needs to be a coordinated effort between the waitress and cook on how the outcome would be..."
1E0l-p3ZjHBV0_NjTrApFg,2,"I've been to Whiskey Joes I believe 2 or 3 times now, and unfortunately each time I went the experience just got worse. My first rating would have been 4 stars, but I'm starting to think it was a fluke the first time we went. I've only ever sat outside, mostly because what my friends have said about the service indoors and even when I go in to use the restroom there's a funky smell in the lobby area. I don't trust funky smells...

Anyhow, as for my first experience oudoors, they still had the fire pits (before they apparently got destroyed in a tropical storm, bring those back!!) and they were AMAZING. We started out at the bar, which was nice, and moved to the fire pits later. Our bartender, a lovely blond, also made my friend and I some of the best drinks we haven't been able to find the equivalent of since. I really don't recommend this place for food, it's simply underwhelming for the price. Go for the drinks and the beach bar. The live music is also a nice touch.

Anyhow, the next time I went they had the tables in the sand instead of the pits, which were terrible because they did not hold the same appeal. First, they acted as heat traps and second, there was absolutely NO lighting so we could not see our food once the sun set. Thirdly, every single table we visited had biting ants! Someone is not paying attention. And the bartenders this round... oui. They delivered very poor service, food, and I was sure they did not know what they were doing mixing drinks. I don't know what you're doing taking a job as a bartender when you don't understand correct alcohol ratios. And the boys both seemed kind of ..... spacey. 

I just feel in general Whiskey Joe's could be a great place, their location is excellent, however I feel like they are a victim of neglect from management. The upkeep, server staff, and food quality are just not up to par."
zZHF43F15t7UAn0WeR0BkQ,3,"I was disappointed in this times visit.  I love the view and the outdoor seating, however, the food was not as great as the many other times we have been here.  The server, Rachael, was sweet and very good and offering suggestions when I couldn't make up my mind.  We had lunch on Sunday and perhaps we were a little too early for the chef to be at his best.  We will sure visit again."
g8AQkkRLeSSTYQyFEizfbw,5,"This place, along with the outside bar/beach area is what you expect when you go to Florida. The outside beach area is pretty busy, full of people of all ages. Great people watching, beach games, and plenty of good drinks.

The main restaurant food was decent. Plenty to choose from. Almost too much at times. But, hey, it's bar food primarily. But, what I really want to give a shout out to is the service. The wait service itself was very good. Very friendly, lots of staff. But the big thing for me was that I left something very important behind. I didn't realize it for a day or so and was in a panic. I realized I had left it at the outside bar. We called, and the owner was kind enough to agree to send it back to us in CT. All we had to do was pay for the shipping. Totally fair. A couple of weeks went by and it hadn't been sent. I called back, spoke to the owner and someone on his staff apologized profusely and had the item overnighted to me (Saturday delivery) on their dime. It was a relief. So, simply because of that, Whiskey Joe's will be the first place we go to when we get back down to the Tampa area. Check 'em out."
VgM3BvO_j1uvj6c20g3-zw,5,the servers inside are nicer than outside && the specials are better inside for happy hour! thank you to the bartender inside for my cup of pickle juice to make pickle backs w later! yur the real mvp!
5GLKsQeQoWbkIM_3QwS3Nw,2,"This place is a hot mess.  This review is bound to be confusing.

The pros?  The beach. The views.  The service.  Live music.  Recreation area.  Being able to pull up in your boat.  The bar area which is great for watching sports.

The cons?  The food is just meh.  The parking is a frigging nightmare.  The cocktails are very watery.  The place is terribly overpriced for such a mediocre meal.  

The absolute worst?  The seagulls.  They are EVERYWHERE. Despite the signs saying ""Do Not Feed The Birds"" you are bound to have some stupid tourist who thinks it's adorable to have the birds flying around you.  Have you people never seen a bird before?  

When these birds start swarming, it is a complete clusterf*ck of a mess.  They swoop down and eat your fries. Or, you could have an experience like I did where a seagull literally crapped on my forehead.  Yes, as I was sitting there eating my salad, a bird used me as target practice and crapped right on my forehead.  I thought it was a raindrop and told my husband that I think it was starting to rain. He looked up at me from his food and just stared at my face.  Then, he took a napkin and started to wipe my forehead.  I was extremely puzzled, but he didn't want to tell me that there was a big wad of green goo sitting above my left eyebrow.  The waitress happened to come out at that exact moment and started cracking up.

""Oh, that happens now and then""

Okay, great.  Thanks for that.  She didn't offer a napkin, or some water to wipe down my toilet face.  Needless to say, I was reasonably annoyed.  Yes, we laughed about it afterwards, but now, every time we pass by there, my husband just starts laughing which annoys the hell out of me.  But, whatever.  It's funny now but at the time, not so much.

If you are looking for beach ambiance, I would highly suggest sitting INSIDE at Whiskey Joe's.  And honestly, there are so many better places to eat in Tampa Bay that offer the same view with all the aforementioned pros along with better food, better parking situation, better drinks and better prices.

As for that seagull?  I hope a big ol' shark jumps up out of the Gulf and eats him.  Jerk."
BZ5GwOhx2wMRjiQo4zHKDg,3,"3 stars for the sunset view and a friendly waiter...we had the mussels, shrimp and sausage quesadilla, and fried swashbuckler basket.  The beer was cold, and the quesadilla was probably my favorite thing.  The fried seafood basket honestly reminded me of Long John Silvers.  I hate to compare them, but I kind of felt like everything was very overpriced for the quality.  I was not a fan of the key lime pie, either.  We ate at Bahama Breeze the next night, and while I know they are both tourist spots...there was no comparison.  Decent enough for beer and a view, but wished we had gone to Bahama Breeze both nights instead."
apxL5Xlz-VjKSXlZdPZrXQ,2,"This restaurant was just ok. We went there because we read that it was a great place to watch the sunset. The patio area was indeed a nice place to do that, and our bartender was very friendly. We had to wait quite a while to be seated inside, and then even longer for service and for food to come. We waited about an hour for our food. It was a busy time at the restaurant, but that still felt like a long time to wait. The drinks were sugary and not very strong at all. They have a lot of drink promotions, most of which will quickly drain your wallet without getting you tipsy. The food was pretty good -  a bit cold, but the snapper was very tasty. They give you huge portions...definitely enough for 2-3 meals, but that wasn't much use to us as we were on vacation and didn't want to take cartons of food back to our hotel. In the end, our bill was nearly $200 for four people...I didn't mind paying it but I can't help but feel that I didn't really get my money's worth."
DNeLdcaeIyLaxIK6xI3m8Q,3,"My overall experience was nice. I went there to celebrate Father's Day with family and friends. Our waitress was very pleasant, I ordered the Joe's Rocking Oyster which supposed to be stuffed with corn bread, corn, andouille sausage, crabmeat & pepperjack cheese. The only ingredient I tasted was the corn bread. The Chipotle Cioppino was excellent! Wish I could have gotten it over rice instead of pasta."
jHHfA4RPVh6kxoxM0pFQsQ,4,Great little spot right on the water. Kind of tucked away. Not super busy or touristy. Grouper tacos were huge and pretty good. Queso was great. Service was great. This would be a good place to stop if you want to stay close to the airport or don't want to hike all the way to Clearwater.
BTrDhEtwZbnpUWRK6rz0Lw,5,"An off the cuff stop while we had a couple of hours to kill was a wonderful experience. After dining on some amazing fish tacos and a pizza washed down with some marvelous cocktails, sitting while soaking our feet in the warm gulf waters was bliss.

Big props to Amy R for taking excellent care of us. We'll be sure to stop in next time we're in the neighborhood!"
xIc-1AYQNAnLq0Hzgz1gNw,5,Great ambiance. Great food- loved the gator bites. The best was the frozen mango mojito! I got the souvenir cup and filled it twice and felt awesome. Loved that it's by the water. Will come back for sure many time!
ptCoWmHtle9327TwJq5Qeg,4,"I had tried Whiskey Joe's at ZooFari years ago. I had really wanted to try their blackened fish sliders. I got that chance today.

We arrived at Whiskey Joe's around 12 noon. Now the place was pretty deserted at this time but it was filling up as we left. Since we got there early - we got a window seat.

I got the blackened fish sliders as requested. They came on the Hawaiian rolls and were excellent. They're also came with a half order of fries...they were also good. This was simple food but it was done very well. This isn't Bern's but then again, this place has a better  view than Bern's.

Whiskey Joe's is most certainly going to attract the tourist crowd, but I did notice a lot of locals there today. The view of the Hillsborough bay is very nice. They clearly have the best view of the bay from here. You are eating over the water. This restaurant is the only place I know on the Tampa side of the bridge where you can see an unobstructed view of the sunset.

I would go back to Whiskey Joe's in a heartbeat. I would like there to be some more people there while I was there, but that didn't change my rating."
OgTi_4zdOFhY2cTxbkfnMw,5,Vanessa is great.  She is on top of her game.  Makes excellent drinks.  Pays attention to the customers.  Remembers drinks.  Love coming to the beach and firepits.
Cvybk_7nGyYQogwgvcOOWw,1,Very  very poor service. When we parked the valet can flying though the parking lot in a costumers car only to yell at us for parking and when we mentioned it in side they didn't even care and from there it only got worst. Would not recommend on service alone
osIP1KjHXsAU-dxuWsEYjg,3,"Like this place..i've only been outside and never yet in the actual restaurant but the bar area is fun, great view and the bartenders are really nice! Beer prices could be better but you expect to pay a lil more in a place like this. It does seem like your in a resort outside..you can play bean bag toss, bonfires, swim, giant tiki hut...its a lot of fun. I havent actually actually eaten here yet but its ""on the list"". Take this place over next door Hogans anyday!!"
Ug-tGVLS-RlAw-23wFpxjQ,3,"I had high hopes for this place. It is in an awesome location right on the beach and you can see boats and jet skis pulling up. The huge tiki bar outside is on the sand which gives it a real beach feel. However it is extremely overpriced. I asked for a double house whiskey and diet and paid $14. I thought that was just absolutely ridiculous. Also, the outside bar smells like it needs a good hose down. Not only is the bar next to a series of Porta potties, but it just smells like it needs to be bleached or disinfected and had an awful stale liquid smell to it. The bar service was actually awful also outside so we had to go inside. The bartender inside was a lot better and able to accommodate not only the tables but her entire bar as well. Again, more overpriced drinks so we ended up leaving. I probably will not come back unless I won the lottery."
sBL1VTb4ocynHcOlr9MY-w,4,"Really good food and awesome atmosohere. I had the grouper sandwich which was excellent. Restaraunt is a little pricey and parking is terrible, however there is a beach bar WITH firepits and live music. Highly recommend!"
ESLqGnP_J_b8RtyvZI-_ww,4,We had lunch and drinks at Whiskey Joe's yesterday! The food was good and the beer was cold! Our waitress Christina was fantastic!! The staff was friendly and professional. We will go back! Thank you Whiskey Joe's
HFUYiu-slEAPkBCIGqUuew,3,Food is decent and the view is nice. I would recommend sitting at the bar for the best service. The servers are almost incapable of doing their jobs. Just walked out after 20 minutes with no service.
88cWqQ_sQ8994Tki7kHimA,4,"Spotted this gem while passing by. It looked like such a great spot to eat outside, we made a u-turn and were not disappointed.

Ordered the crab cakes, mani mahi tacos, and fire cracker shrimp tacos. I love Maryland blue crab cakes and these were a 4 out of 5. Fire cracker shrimp was the the best thing we ordered, tangy, and spicy, very fun. Mahi mahi was bland.

Great views of the bay and a great spot to eat outside. Maybe a great place to wait out Tampas rush hour."
IHoihEyC6KbcfNXYhnYEkw,1,"Worst valet, worst dead faced ladies/hosts as you walk in, and terrible customer service. Their was no one showing even a bit of excitement about their jobs. As a business owner from Las Vegas, NV I know how important it is to greet your customers and make them feel welcome.  This evening for the first time in a long time I felt bad for all the other people who too will have this experience after initially being excited to try something new."
sV5xcvV96bsxZgToaAHthA,4,Best freaking wings sweet coconut rum sauce will be back.first time here good service
a6AEHeTGzNAtNa5GrxccDA,5,"Fun location right on the beach! Was able to get a seat on the patio to watch the sunset, are waiter was awesome, and the food was good! It definitely has a tropical feel!"
Dyhr6zCKEKK9EzSS-dVueA,4,"We've been wanting to go to this place for a few weeks. We're very new to the area and decided to try it out the other day. It was pretty slammed there. They actually have valet parking. I'm not sure, but making a reservation is possible. We started off at the bar, but ended up moving outside. We ordered the whiskey pepper dippin shrimp (I had them put the gross feta on the side) and it was by far the most delicious shrimp dish I've had...maybe ever! 
My fella ordered the grouper with rice, broccoli, and got a GIANT Cobb salad (he had them bring out the salad first). The salad was amazing (juicy grilled chicken, bacon, mangos, and more) and could be an actual entree (without blue cheese, please). I got the fish (pollock) and chips. The seasoning on the fries was yummy and the fish was well-flavored. I will say we probably won't order all this food next time. We were wicked full after inhaling the app and salad. We had some full to-go boxes. Even though it was very busy, our service was solid and waitress was efficient. We'll go back again and try other stuff :)

(Edited May 28, 2017...They no longer serve the whiskey dippin shrimp and that was my favorite thing on the menu. We came back a few times after finding that out and haven't been back anymore)."
slbWivHrwHs917P9zVqq8A,3,"This is a great place with phenomenal scenery and even better food. Some of the best nachos I've ever had. My friends and I like to come here to explore the drink menu and enjoy these nachos. I was there today and the waiter I had was one of the rudest most unprofessional waiters I've ever seen. He clearly seemed bothered to be serving for your establishment. We ordered nachos with no meat because a friend is a vegetarian, his response was why don't you just get chips and Queso. My other friend asked to order a drink he rolled his eyes and said sure very snarky. After we enjoyed the natural and a round of drinks I decided I wanted to order some. Unfortunately I cannot tell you how these because our waiter do not come back for at least 30 minutes. We had to ask another waitress to get our checks well he still had 10 feet away staring at usAfter receiving my check I forgot that I wanted to get my whiskey Joe points. I turned around and flagged him like you do do anyway and are in an establishment. He told his table to hang on because we want to do something again. At which point the girl again came to take care of it. Unfortunately he did not even give us a name or gladly tell you it was. Feel free to message me and I will give you. Info to pull my check."
IVP5c8NosQr9jOWWuwER_A,5,"This place is awesome, and the wait staff is great.  Jenn took care of us all day and we had a huge group. She rocks! If you're looking for fun in the sand and close to Tampa, this is your place. Boaters welcome too!"
kSKZsiPVsJF6muNzCa8L0A,2,"Whiskey Joe's is like Jimmy Buffet's Margaritaville or Sammy Hagar's Cabo Wabo minus the celebrity name.  The location is actually quite nice, right on the water and there is a public dock to tie up your boat.  There are beach volleyball nets nearby and the people watching can be decent.  That being said, the food is unremarkable and the drinks are average.  The place screams tourist trap yet a number of locals seem to find their way there.  Give it a try, but don't say I didn't warn you!"
vwCqQzSGgNrdOXdHsOCD0A,5,"I had the pleasure of visiting for the first time since I moved to Tampa on last weekend. The food was really good and the service was pretty fast. I sat outdoors with a view of the water. My waitress was absolutely amazing. Christine G. - Somehow she managed to run the outside bar, while taking orders and making sure that I had everything I needed. I was really impressed. She's a gem Whiskey Joe's.

I had the Grand Grouper Sandwich along with the Island Firecracker Shrimp. Both were tasty items.

If you haven't visited this place, give em a try. It's a lively place on a Sunday! Guaranteed to have a great time."
PIXGCR7Wsf5HjdigkcsisQ,4,"We dined outside so we could enjoy the water and the beach-goers while we consumed our meal.

The service was a little slow, but the staff was friendly enough.

Eventually we moved fron a high table to the bar in order to avoid cigarette smoke. That move gave us an even better view of the jet skiers.

The gumbo was delicious and filled with vegetables & andouille sausage. The jerk chicken sandwich was fresh and the chicken seasoned perfectly. I really enjoyed the fries that were crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside."
HbsRVtyQQJWqLihv43_QSA,5,Chilling and some good drinks and a nice party with my wife. Awesome place to stay and have fun
6DcSC9rKNAdOVLJjObyMzw,5,"We have been here half a dozen times, and have never been disappointed. Great food, great beer selection, and a wonderful beach area with a third bar on the sand.
We watched a great Van Halen cover band here. Great service, good prices, clean establishment. My wife and I are huge fans of this place!"
uZafBR8T3UpODJ59sDX6sA,5,"I don't know if we got lucky or what, but I showed up on a random chilly Tuesday evening with about 25 coworkers who just made it into town but we still had awesome service! I think there was maybe one bartender and one server, but they kept up just fine. Try the WJ's blonde if you're a beer drinker!"
4DnvTR95UWVH-CXmV9mB8w,2,"One of my first dining experiences while visiting Tampa and just let me say, I was hoping Tampa had better to offer.

We ordered the following:

1. Sliders
2. Calamari
3. Oysters
4. Shrimp

Food was standard. Nothing really special. Things seemed as though they were thrown together.  Nothing tasted great and everything tasted average.

Service wasn't very good. Although the place was empty, it took a while for waiters to come serve us. 

Nice view of the bay. Just about the best part of the experience."
Mg1KAzFVcuWN6ZZIQfZ4bw,3,Only stopped by for a few drinks after visiting the train wreck across the water known as Hogans beach. The place was nice but not very crowded at all. I like how you can sit by the water with your toes in the sand and just relax. Other than that they had decent music and one hott bartender out of 4.
TkGRbz566qTHc6Xm34C9Xg,2,"Great location, superb view and beautiful server, but don't go there for the food or drinks. Seafood is bland and bad prepared, the scallops tasted like cardboard and the mango sauce only diminished the dish. The shrimps were overcooked, too fried and a funky hot sauce"
FWXKN7YTkohN_y2MRUIqxw,2,"I would give this restaurant one star if it weren't for the location. Service is slow. A bit pricey for what you get. I was there two weeks ago and ordered nachos.  I specifically ordered them with no tomatoes.  But, I got a plate of nachos loaded with tomatoes. So I had to send them back. Guess what? Got my second plate of nachos with tomatoes. Again! What is going on here? Never going back."
jmRkfRNw1STx-kWuI5ipcg,5,"Best tiki bar around! Good size beach, tiki tables, fire pits, a stage and dance floor. Great place to have a good time. Great vibe! The TVs were a tad small (I was trying to watch football), but with such a great atmosphere it's not a deal breaker. 

Our bartender Caroline was fun and attentive. 

This is going to be a regular stop."
33TzKqFs8-58QnF5m5Zr8A,3,"Great sunsets; limited menu more like Joe's Crabshack...Had the blacken Grouper...Overall good atmosphere for a large group...reminds me of Seacrets in Ocean City, MD..."
fGFkfq4Utg9-w8U5xZMNLw,1,Worst service ever waited over 30 min to have a waitress come over I guess they were too busy texting and doing there hair at service bar so decided to leave just absolutely terrible do not go great view great location and can not tell u more when no one cares to make money wanted to make a day of it spend some money they lost a customer for life and will tell every one I know not worth it !!!
DzVgq1zBIZDxBjtJpPztJQ,3,"We had some friends from California come to visit and had driven past this place heading to the beach. When we drove by it looked really full of life and cool so we drove out the following day. 

We got there really early as we had only planned on staying for a couple of hours. We walk to the beach/outside area and they have a DJ and lots of people crowded around the bar (it was a Saturday about 11ish or 12 if I remember correctly). The seating is first come first serve there's plenty of tables and chairs that don't have shade (which is kind of disappointing as it gets hot in the sun) but then there's also tables hut style with shade but those are the first ones taken of course. We got lucky that as we got there someone was leaving so we were able to find seating.

They head to the bar area which is super packed and kind of all over the place. Took forever to get our drinks and the area kind of smelled (could be because the porter potties are literally right next to the bar) so we only got up when we needed a drink. Come to find out there's waiters walking around so we really didn't have to walk up!! We never got greeted or asked if we were helped so that was a huge let down! 

We go to the bar to order some appetizers as we started to get hungry. We then had to keep going to the bar to keep checking on our order because the bartender said to come check on it. They don't bring it to us. Aside from it being pricey the portions were okay but it's not like you get what you paid for. We ordered gator bites they weren't all gator bites they threw in fried pickles and onion rings with the calamari. Wish I would've taken pictures.

We got tired of having to get up and walk to the bar so we were able to finally flag down a waitress. She was very friendly (forgot her name) though we had to flag her down ever so often but it beat having to go to the bar. 

The DJ was cool so the atmosphere was great. There was also hookah available which was even better. We had such a blast we didn't leave until 530 or 6 lol!"
fcpZaQrEnShRiiizwGcYrA,5,Came here after a cruise and before a flight (had about 5 hours to kill). They stored our luggage for free. We ate at the restaurant and then hung out at their private beach until we needed to go to the airport. There are showers and bathrooms so perfect for travelers. Right next to the airport so we didn't hit any traffic. Very friendly staff!
cyGrSwJLA77nFN70C7SvWA,1,"This is a criticism. I ordered a dozen oysters and got 8. I ask about the count and they said because they were so big that they only serve 8. The menu says clearly states half dozen and a dozen, not weight. Just because they buy large oysters is not my problem. They need to change the menu if They want to change by the weight. I have been coming here for 5 years and this has never been a problem. This is just an example of low character of the management on duty, But to be fair it is usually a good bar and the wait staff is very excellent"
XvGorQDSWY-Xc8hlAFRIlA,1,Very subpar. Read other yelp reviews and hoped it was ok here anyway. Nachos had a big meatball of taco meat which was very pink inside. Find somewhere else.
dZZu279ip3tgDfGKgVcuuA,5,"Came to Whiskey Joes for lunch. It has great sitting outside on the patio and inside with wide open windows overlooking the ocean. Amazing views and their portion sizes of food are excellent for sharing! 
I ordered their bowl of Spicy Island Gumbo ($8 & large size) and it tasted good and could be a meal if you were looking for a little bit lighter lunch portion. Also ordered the Snapper in Paradise which was at least a 6oz piece of fish topped with tomatoes and sauce that was delicious. It came with two sides and I ordered the broccoli and fries. ($26) Wasn't too fond of the broccoli, needed seasoned and was half way raw. It is slightly higher in price, but know that their portions make up for it and the sizes are worth the price. 
Only other thing that I didn't know is that there is valet parking only in their lot which is $5. 
I didn't get to go on the beach area because it was windy and slightly raining, but looks great and relaxing! Will be back to sit out and relax in the sun!

*************
Updated September 5, 2018

Came here for lunch today and went out to the beach area for the first time. What an amazing spot to sit, relax, listen to music, have a cocktail and some great tasting seafood! 

Tons of beach chairs to sit on (none to lay on to tan your back side) with tiki huts and high tops to sit at as well. They have a nice large tiki bar outside with full bar and a few TVs. You can order food at the bar and they will bring it out (look out for seagulls!) 

Ordered the coconut crusted mahi on the appetizer menu and it was delicious! It was $14 with two kinds of sauces including mango / orange flavor and a sweet chili sauce which were both good. And large portion! Def can split this appetizer or have it as your meal. Great food and view of the ocean! Can't wait to come back for their happy hour from 4:00-7:00"
sq_XyBf-44OoouaLrgQtWA,4,"Best Beer Cheese Soup in town and the Calamari Appetizer was great, but prices are a little high though."
ZhtT-3MtH1wK8AmDYTQZZg,1,"Very disappointing meal. The beer wasn't cold but the food was. After sending back a raw hamburger, I received another that tasted like it was made the day before. My wife had the fish tacos. They were ok, but nothing spectacular. The views of the bay are great, too bad the food doesn't match."
GEla4jl3yIwOKauf6VJ_nw,3,"Great for casual waterfront dining or drinks. The food is good, but priced a little higher than maybe what it should be. They have a great beer selection along with a full bar. It is a great place to watch the sunset on a nice evening. They are dog friendly on the deck. 

Also, if you are driving know that the parking lot is valet only (it is complementary, but if you don't have extra cash for a tip it can make for an awkward interaction)."
tsxb6rGJno0jtVQPhIlm7A,3,"New Years was awesome! Two bands, one inside and one outside on the beach. Low cover and plenty of drinks. The staff were very nice. Great way to bring in 2017."
kR8mZOZ3brsbQa7ncUeLzQ,3,"Food was alright, service not so good but our waitress/bartender was nice. the view was great and really enjoyed the sun set on beach and drinking hurricanes."
mG7JhTXYi4lXVT9_mOTt7A,2,"We sat on the ""beach"" and enjoyed some adult beverages while listening to the loudest, most annoying rap music ever.  Sorry - I want Jimmy Buffet or Bob Marley while on the beach.  Hate rap so it will always effect my reviews.  Food was bad too.  You would think an order of peel and eat shrimp on a Florida beach would be a no brainer but this was tasteless and mushy.  Waitress though was really good and attentive - 4 starts for her - just wish I could remember her name!"
nlNCCvuu88ZCCssLz9ASmQ,1,"WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!! I've ordered take out before and loved the coconut chicken. However this time we decided to go in and enjoy the atmosphere (Terrible decision). The food was dropped off by another employee who we asked if we could have silverware. 5 minutes go by no silverware and our server was no where to be found. We then went to the bar and asked for silverware but we're not given napkins. We were hungry so we started eating but eventually wanted napkins, of course server still no where to be found. We asked another employee for napkins and then our server came out of no where and began cussing and arguing with us saying he gave us silverware..? We asked to speak to a manager instead of being cursed at and the manager didn't do anything but take a drink off of our check. Not to mention the entire time the server was standing behind the manager flicking us off. This is unbelievable service for a place in such a nice location. I will most definitely never come back nor will anyone I know if it's up to me."
_ZztgJwTjmbDkQtaJrUg_Q,1,Extremely dissatisfied and disappointed customer a group of us about 50 people ages 40 to 60yrs from Apollo Beach got together and had a pub crawl  wiskey Joes  was our 2nd stop it all started 1st Beach area was not open as promised so group had to go in by bar area then ordered a drink then bartender wouldn't take credit card for payment because no chip in card said it was their policy so told her forget it here's cash then went to patio outside with wife and friends we are all standing talkin all sudden  a staff member comes rushing out  to patio agressively and raised voice at me asking if I put the umbrella up I said no then he says just leave it don't touch it and storms off I'm looking at everyone like what just happened.then one of the ladies in our group was celebrating her birthday so part of group started singing  Happy birthday and then manager comes over and says everyone in group is now cut off from food and alcohol and some people already ordered and paid for food which some didn't even get to enjoy their meal basically paid for something for nothing.and they kicked us out what a shame this is how they run a business turning away people who can spend money  which most business would welcome shame on those who manage to run this place along with  staff. U are going to sink this business u keep this up and don't wisen up
WeWgP4AZ_end3QQjxvckGw,1,"This place sucks. Takes an hour to get food, and nothing special about the food. Their house beers aren't good either, best to stick to some craft beer."
lm2Aq_Q7l1pR7YKK6xHkaQ,5,"Awesome spot right on the beach! Easy to get to & very accommodating! Casual and fun, you can sit outside right over the water or stay inside with great water views too! They have multiple bars and fun coconut drinks. I had the best fish sandwich - huge portions & bf had the white sand pizza. Both very delicious as we sat and looked out at the water & the Pelicans.

Our waiter, Alex, was extremely friendly and happy to serve us! He made it a fun time here right from the start! ask for him! 

This has been one of the best spots I've been to yet down here in FL!"
gWoKMY8xojT9Tf42OAE0Nw,2,"If I could give an extra half star I would it does not quite rate the full 3.  The service was slow, the food was less than stellar but.... i knew what i was getting into.  what this place my lack in quality and efficiency it makes up for in location....  it is literally just a couple of minutes from the airport and makes a great ""last stop before you go"" place to grab a cocktail as you await your flight (or waiting to pick someone up).  Sand, Water and a tiki bar!   I will say that the parking is a nightmare so your best bet is to just pay for valet.....  but again, its a BAR ON THE BEACH, that was what I was looking for!"
r8IYIOP53FoHWkGRIsqPAA,1,"We visited this terrible establishment on New Year's Eve in which we were greeted with judgement, outrageous prices for bottom shelf liquor and ran out of Yeungling after one drink ( both times I've been here they run out after one drink). If you enjoy being overcharged for crappy drinks and average food then this is the place for you. I recommend this place dearly to all of my enemies. Never. The portopotties are free, but you lose a few ounces of humanity and if you want to use the facilities inside you have to pay a cover. WTF? Sincerely a disgruntled customer"
xyTEuV8XIOj9SQH7A2Zgvw,3,"The food is fine - typical beach bar food. The PARKING IS HORRENDOUS. They have only valet parking and when that fills up they tell you to park off site at another location. The process is longer and annoying and it will make you 30-45 minutes late if you have an reservation. The hostess staff was also not very understanding or helpful in regards to some of our party being delayed due to Whiskey Joe's parking situation breakdown. Go to the light and make the U turn because you'll wait 20 minutes to turn into the restaurant only to be told you can't park there. UPDATE: Valet parking is $5 and cash only at the off site parking with a free shuttle. Those guys are awesome and really put up with a lot, tip them well! The free parking ,on the very small Ben T Davis Beach, is not an ideal option because you enter and exit from the same point as WJ customers. The beach parking is backed up with a line of cars waiting to exit but only after the cars entering the lot to try to valet park clear up. I watched them to sit in their cars to leave the lot longer than I did to enter it. It would have been helpful if at the time our reservation was made we were told ""Hey, it gets insanely busy and packed here. Your party should arrive 30-45 minutes early.""  We spoke to our server about her experience and they also are late due to the same traffic issues as was the server/worker who was in the free shuttle ride with me. Spring break or not, we have great weather most of the time, I'm positive this is a regular occurrence. Just be ready to deal with some hassles and to wait, prepare in advance. I wish someone told us - so I'm telling you. BTW-uncle bens minute rice is very TYPICAL - I didn't say it was bad, it's just what you would expect."
czd6qxI0m-v43CNlww2fjQ,3,"I went here on a Sunday, which is reggae night and there is a cover charge to go down on the beach. The only reason why I went here is because I had a friend coming into town and she wanted to go here so I met her there.

The parking is ridiculous. Most of the lot is valet and if they are full you are screwed. When I first arrived, it was full so I had to go to the adjacent beach parking to try and find a spot. The parking machine was not giving people receipts, which you are supposed to put on your dash so they know you paid. I did not put money in and decided to try the restaurant again because in the meantime my friend got there and she was able to park. Well the parking gods must have smiled on me because I snagged a non-valet spot on the way to valet.

I am in my 40s and this is not my scene. The waitress was dingy and I paid cash because I didn't feel comfortable giving them my card and having them hold it at the bar.

The place was pretty packed though and there were cops watching from a deck above, as well as cops patrolling the water because the waterway is between two party spots (this place and the Beach) so I would say that is plus.

There did seem to be a pretty good band that was starting when I was going home so it may be a really good place to go for live music.

I think I would feel different about the place if parking wasn't such a pain and if I was on vacation.  I live here though and in Pinellas County there are a lot of beach bars I would pick over this place, but because it is located in Hillsborough, near the airport and hotels, I am guessing it is popular among people who don't want to drive all the way out to the beach."
JH_Nhne10jTIygTpLMWkFg,3,"VEGAN REVIEW: We came down for Parents weekend at UT and this place was a request of non-vegan family members. Full disclosure we did review the menu beforehand and saw there was only 2 possible items that could have been veganized: Hummus appetizer and a veggie pizza. 
Great ambiance with that Caribbean outback vibe. Pulling up... there is a long valet line and long waits for tables. If you want to skip the restaurant, the ""beach"" is first come first serve. More about that later. 
We opted for outdoor seating on the water. Pretty views and the weather was perfect for outdoor dining. Our waiter was friendly and accommodating. Fun drink menu with zany names and concoctions. We ordered the hummus plate as an appetizer without the tsaztsiki.  It was actually the best hummus plate I've had aside from Greek restaurants...came with olives, marinated cherry tomatoes, banana peppers, pita and cucumbers. We asked our waiter if the chef could prepare something special for us considering they had pasta and veggies. He made a linguine with brushetta, olive oil and mushrooms. I requested a side of the mango salsa and mixed it in there. It was decent for a meal but I wonder why they couldn't have a black bean burger on their menu. I find this so often and news flash: veganism isn't a new fad...it's been around for 70+ years as an American lifestyle and diet and much longer in other cultures. I understand a local whiskey seafood shanty isn't going to have garlic roasted tofu with a balsamic reduction over steamed quinoa but is a black bean burger with avocado and mango salsa too much to ask for? 
And the beach...we decided to go check it out. Definitely a fun place to hang. Firepits, tiki torches, live music, cocktails, sand...what's not to love? Good times and definitely a place I'd love to return to as soon as they get a couple more vegan options."
0U2xKKDckA1HXd7HpIqNtA,4,"We had a great time here yesterday. We have only been once before and we really like it. 
Julia is a great bartender and we will definitely be back."
-2NJGWUJtxBEmCDuQL_gIA,3,"We discovered this great spot on a business trip to Tampa. The food, service, and atmosphere were excellent. Our server Neil, took such good care of us and was a great person! There is a deck to sit and enjoy the view too."
bjBn650FTyk0wZIgLkF03A,4,"Amazing location! On the beach with the coolest vibe. Watching the jet skiers was great and the sunset was beautiful. You can eat on the deck or on the beach. My sister and I ate inside seated by the windows. Great view! The staff are pleasant and helpful. My sister had the Jerk chicken sandwich and fries. She said it was very good. I ordered the grouper sandwich that came with fries, coleslaw. The grouper was bland, not even salt. It could have used some seasoning like garlic, salt, paprika and crushed thyme. Try it! The fries were to salty. The drinks were great! Atmosphere great! The grouper average. You may wonder way I gave them 4 stars. I'm not going to give them a low score based on one bland meal."
ohCo18s397kRq9FEIgB1vw,5,"Had the carnitas, 10/10 would come again, prices aren't terrible considering the area, and the proportions were handsome."
MXpXFW4J4j-NBDVaZZJcdw,4,"We had the Jamaican fish and the fried seafood platter. Everything was excellent, but the Jamaican sauce was just ok (not great). Prices are very reasonable considering the quality of the food. Service outside by the bar was fast and polite. The food came out quickly and the sunset was beautiful. I highly recommend!"
rxowN5BLo25EQyT8BtmXwQ,5,Recommended by my sister and was not disappointed. Wings were exceptional and calamari strips were very good!  Drinks were on point and souvenir cups were a nice addition for keepsake purposes.  Enjoyed the view as well.  Thanks!
21rqpANHZBNpIiqOWvfeNA,5,"I was in town and my friend brought my here. The food was amazing and plentiful. I also love that they had the outside bar on the water. We ate inside and then went outside. The service inside was great. The service outside could have been better, seems like it took forever to get anyone's attention. I would definitely come here again when I'm in town."
yAC8dyU7a_lFUIYXV_WRXw,4,"What a great spot to enjoy a view of the water with a cocktail and grab a bite to eat. We had the grouper sandwich and the mini sliders, have I had better, yes but the food was still pretty good. Lets face it you go to the place for water views and fun. Joe's has a big deck with a 8 seat bar that looks over the water, seems likes a good place to grab the view you probably came here for. They have a barefoot beach bar that looks like fun too if you want sand in between your toes and a cold beer in your hand."
7aDDuXJ3P47rClwG7TK3Rw,5,Killer on the beach joint! Blackened fish tacos local Cigar City beer! Great server thanks Beth!! Must do classic Fla place!
mS-L1kYkOg3RCJ064NeOWw,4,"Being an out-of-towner, this place was recommended to me by a few different people. It did not disappoint. Large beach with fireplaces set up for these cool October nights. Good selection of local craft brews. The food for our party of three arrived on time ,was piping hot and tasted delicious. The view of the Bay from our little Tiki table was also soothing and relaxing, especially watching the boats come in and dock."
WcAdmfZwtkxlJi0CzLhs4Q,3,"I can not believe I never reviewed this place. Why have I gone here a bunch of times?  Well, it is a step from the airport. People I pick up from the airport or take to the airport end up here.
This place has a great view of the water. This is a typical touristy place where you feel like you are in Florida bc the sun is shining in all directions and the heat is permeating you to the max. It's nice and they have tiki huts also that I have not been able to get to. They allow dogs as well. The menu is the usual grill kind of place and not that extraordinary. The drinks are great though and they have great service. I'm sure I will be back when I have more visitors come."
17JpJHNoGhMy9tm4ExeOOg,4,If you want a restaurant where you can watch the sunset on tampa this is the place. They have a private beach with corn hole and volleyball along with a beach bar. The food here is ok but I like whiskey joe's more as a place to hangout and grab a drink with my toes buried in the sand.
ob1lExlOzBq1W07s8HWMdQ,4,Beautiful place to relax with a few drinks and watch the sunset. At night they have bonfires scattered along the beach and it's a very relaxed atmosphere with great music. They also have jet skis to rent if you're feeling a little adventurous!
4WlgVyCVpRa-QtC3i9Mc0w,2,"Honestly, this place was a HUGE disappointment. We had slow service from start to finish. It took 20+ minutes to get our drinks and another 30+ minutes to get our appetizers. Conveniently, it took 10 minutes to get our main dishes. I ordered the Jambalaya, which was delicious and very hot, temperature wise. My friend ordered the Shrimp Tacos which was all mayonnaise and grease with ice cold fried shrimp. One side of the table was given their plates of food while the other side of the table waited another 10 minutes for their food. The waiter completely forgot to get one of our friend's food. I will say that we had a 12 top table, but the restaurant appeared very slow. They didn't even give our waiter a helper given the party size. He spent so much time running around and he seemed very flustered."
XccaAj3Ug1oExof6aoJrMw,3,"Basically a beach bar targeting tourists.   A fine view or Tampa Bay from the Tampa side of Courtney Campbell, with lots of deck seating and natural breeze.  Drinks are fine but predictably pricey.  Service is relaxed.  Just had some apps from the usual list of tacos, wraps, and fried seafood."
9s1O8kZ0eDucGiD1mXDDjQ,4,"A way to spend a Sunday afternoon, right on the water. The drinks tasty and the food was  good, the only complaint was the required valet service. There was a wait for us to retrieve our vehicle and congested leaving the parking lot."
vW4ucOkxBD0c6TyhubHI_w,4,"i super enjoyed this place, i had the carnitas and they were spectacular, also tried the pork tacos which were full of so much pork, omg so good!  be cautious of the pizza though, its listed as ""new york style"" and its simply a flatbread pizza, that's not new york style at all, it tasted good though, just thought we were getting something else"
OyJfnRY98Ua9HprmCVp8bg,4,"I liked everything here, from food to ambience. A perfect place to have good food and enjoy a beautiful sunset. Being on a sea shore is just the right place to be in  loved it!"
Vxyvje5MzvkPCAQVABxkuA,4,"Yes the uniforms the staff has to wear hurts my eyes and you know you are at some type of tourist location as you pass through Ye Olde Gift Shoppe on your way in and out of the attraction but...
I've only eaten there recently at lunch and was lucky enough not to get attacked or by a flock angry sea gulls and if they would have pooped on me I would have ran, ran so far away I could have got away.
Back to the food, two salads, one appetizer and a couple of glasses of house Sauvignon were ordered. I have to agree it was not the least expensive lunch and if it wasn't for the beautiful surroundings, pleasant staff and decent food I would probably drive past in the future but...."
Oh7fhApyPGDORtXBb34iJQ,5,"Have to start with the view. The wife and I are huge fans of food on the water, especially coming from the desert, and Whiskey Joe's doesn't disappoint. It's right on the causeway and the patio is right on Tampa Bay. We went for mid-week lunch and I wish I had tried the gator bites. The firecracker shrimp tacos were fantastic as was her requisite chicken sandwich since she doesn't eat seafood. Service was solid ... and did I mention the views?"
_4iGrX9vpfPPwHT40pjaEg,3,"I have been going to Whiskey  Joe's  since the original one opened. Yes, it can feel touristy, but if you are a Native, it can also feel like home.
Surrounded by Tampa Bay, a beack, outside bar, Tiki, you can put your toes in the sand & bring your best 4 legged friend. Who can't find something to love about that vibe, not me.
Parking is a pure nightmare! Just be prepared for it before you go & it won't ruin your fun. Service is generally good, as they want to keep you eating & drinking. The food, defiantly not stellar or even close.
I used to experiment with different dishes and just got too frustrated. I really enjoy their Wisconsin  Cheddar  soup & boiled shrimp, a perfect meal for me. You can't mess up the soup, it's  premade. The shrimp occasionally  come overcooked or too soggy, but they have no problem replacing them.
A great place to chill and enjoy where you live!
What's  a  girl  to  do? Try to enjoy where I live & take advantage of places that put me in my element of water & sunshine."
Nckabh7u9OUDz5FjAQc19Q,2,Nice view on water.  It was recommended by the concierge desk at hotel.  Limes in my mojito were old. (brown edges)   The blackened grouper was average.   Not much fish and the shrimp rubbery.
hNkAZaheHk3PBMrtr38CSw,1,"They get a 1 star because it was a gorgeous place to eat with a gorgeous view. But everything else was bad. My wife had a live beetle crawling around the pecans in her salad. And that was their signature salad.  They took it off the bill but didn't offer a bug less one. We called ahead for a party of 12 and then waited more than an hour after we got there. They had quoted 30-40 minutes.  The service was excruciatingly slow.  The fish dinners were too greasy to eat.  We don't recommend the swashbuckler as it is just a tub of greasy fish and fries. We would never go there again, and everyone in our party agrees. Save yourself from starvation and wanting to throw up and go somewhere else!"
blMl9S8TfTDphqzQK-lljQ,3,Whiskey Joe's has done a lot to improve this restaurant over the years. The have waterfront seating and a beach tiki bar. Both make for an enjoyable Florida atmosphere when the weather is right.  During my recent visit I got the naked colada which is basically a pina colada mixed with delicious black spiced rum. The Jamaican Jerk chicken sandwich was served with yummy fries. Both were pretty good. Sit outside and enjoy a frozen drink....it might smell a little funky....don't worry you get used to it :)
zH5f8UVej3Lm5rgwOIXMyQ,1,You completely suck as an establishment. Unprofessional staff including management. Place for drama and boring. You can't handle large groups. You lose profit because of how you run your business. You cater to trash instead. You turn down people that can actually spend money here and trash talk to other businesses if those groups are headed there. Don't bother to have your piss aunts even communicate on your behalf. You will loose a lot of business.
YMNQGflQshhrYgUF2qOC1g,5,"Totally confused about the low ratings I'm seeing. Stumbled upon this place on our way to Clearwater. Jumped off of the road to grab lunch and ended up staying and enjoying the awesome beach ambience. I had the shrimp scampi appetizer and my friend had fish and chips. We also shared a nacho/queso/beef appetizer. We enjoyed everything we had!! The bartenders were great at the bar and we enjoyed our drinks, as well. We came back later the same night because they have a separate tiki bar, firepits, & performance stage. We had a blast listening to the DJ and later the live band. We also ended up eating dinner there. My friend had the steak tacos and I had wings. We enjoyed our dinner, too! Perfect beach bar, equipped with entertainment at night. Can't beat it!!!"
S41Y1dM6oP3fbfVLY3Qjig,1,If I could select NO STAR I would. Horrible service and really quite frankly the WORST food I have EVER had!!!! It was so bad that I actually threw up shortly after the dinner. Over cooked fish and microwaved veggies!!! We also ordered pizza that totally was freezer burned with bad veggies! Do NOT go here. You have been warned!!
sW0cxu1_WuOK1tb77h-gyg,4,"You really can't beat the view here. They have their own private sandy beach. I chilled with some good friends earlier in the day on a weekday so it wasn't that busy, which was great because iv'e seen this place get PACKED!  
There is nothing better than some cold beer on a hot ass day with some sandbags to play a few games of sand bag toss with your buddies. We stayed and watched the sunset. Tried some food, the fish tacos were nasty, my friends had the pulled pork sandwiches. Too salty for them. The food is meh. 
Don't expect it to be as great as the view. I would have rated it a five if the food was good. Whiskey Jose's is a wonderful hang out if you are lookin to have a good time with your friends and get some drinks."
AvqrzpS-mQ78C3qmqWkyNw,2,"The owners certainly listened in school when they taught the #1 rule of business is location, location, location! Unfortunately I think they realize they will be successful on tourists regardless of service or food. Service was a cluster; table next to us was smoking cigarettes non-stop until I had to say something; and WHO THE F? SERVES SEAFOOD GUMBO WITH RAW UNCOOKED RICE?????!!!!"
90GFdiCTxSgFKHYr1tVCjA,3,"This place is located near the airport so it is a great palce to head to if i ever have a friend or family friend on a layover between catching their next flight. We inicially came here because we wanted to have a beer while watching the sunset. Whiskey joe has limited free parking but they have paying parking nearby. During happy hour this place is packed. They had yeunling at $3 and some drinks at $6.  On our first round we ordered two yeunglings but on our second round i decided to try the margarita and it was not worth it. Next time i'm sticking to beer. We also wanted to share a bite to eat and ordered flat crusted cheese pizza (8 pieces). It was just ok- nothing to write about but i would not order it again. I would probably return when if a friend is on a layover. Other than that, i'd probably head elsewhere."
SyaJYTPkxUlwIwUsTRVrHw,1,I ordered the gator bites & we got more fried pickles than gator bites never again! They slackin! The server did nothing about it either!
5lagx1093q9OiKApb_jeAA,5,Amazing food!! Veggie pizza is a must! Their beach bar is the perfect place to unwind and the live music is always entertaining! Reasonably priced as well!! Must visit!
mTChAqOuAhzsfRxbs2V63Q,5,"In town for the Memorial Day Holiday Weekend, and stop here for drinks and food! The view is awesome!!! Had some great food and an OUTSTANDING server, ARI! She was very helpful with items suggestions on the menu, very friendly, great customer service! If you are in the area, please stop in and enjoy great water views, live music, and ask for ARI for superb service! Thanks ARI!!!"
AgnzP_vGC5myPktdOb0eGg,4,"Great location, good food. Prices are a bit high for the quality but the location doesn't get better. Great for any age or crowd. Beautiful sunsets."
EbxyUVB3OXeAx6H95KRn1A,1,"We never actually got to order any food.  When we arrived, we were told there would be a 30 minute wait.  We decided to wait )wound up being 45 minutes).  When we were seated, took another 30 minutes until someone took our order.  30 more minutes and still no food.  When we finally flagged down our server, she said she would check on it and did not return for another 20 minutes and which point we left.  Terrible service!"
0Y1db779oH2OzSczlAF0Ww,2,"I asked the concierge at my hotel for a local dive that sold good food cheap. This place is not that.  It's a tourist trap with mediocre food and moderate prices.  I should have known when I walked in and saw a gift shop selling Whiskey Joe's tee shirts.  I was hungry and it was traffic hour so I stayed rather than try to find some other place. 

I ordered the blackened grouper and it came out quickly. The first thing I noticed was that it appeared everything was reheated including the fish. The ""fresh steamed"" vegetables were still cold as was the rice. The cold was not room temp, but fridge cold.  I gave the fish a shot and it was just ok. It may have been reheated as well since the blackened portions had no crisp. Overall it was disappointing."
5H5WVi2Glss7UT1Psy6ZDw,3,"Nothing spectacular but just what you want in a cheesy beachside resturant/bar. Alligator heavy decor, lovely view of the water, indoor & outdoor seating, reasonable prices, ok food. We had the gator bites (yum), firecracker shrimp (chewy but liked the sweet & sour sauce), bbq pizza (my boyfriend was a fan, there was a lot of meat on it - pork & bacon) & Caribbean Cobb salad (I loved it - mango, pineapple & fresh jalapeño in addition to your standard Cobb salad ingredients). Slow but friendly service."
xz3XfPcFlG1ax-oq9BkpTQ,2,"Ehhh, unlikely I will return.  Quick Version: Bad service and everyone looks like they'd rather be somewhere else.

I arrived to the restaurant and since I was a party of one, they assumed that I did not want a table.   The host and hostess kind of waved me in the area of the bar seating.  I asked for a table, (there were obviously plenty available), and I was pressured to sit in bar area.  I sat in Bar for almost 20 minutes without being greeted.  FYI, I counted the time on my phone.  

Mind you all employees are chatting each other up, and playing and interacting with each other. Although some appeared busy there was definitely a choice to be inattentive.  

In addition, why does it look like everyone just rolled out of bed?  I get a laid back environment in addition to working in outdoor conditions, however, I would expect to be groomed with decent clothes at your workplace.  The ladies all wear messy buns and look like they haven't combed their hair since yesterday.   It appears that the employees where their ""old"" workout gear or tethered clothes because they are in a laid back environment.  There are multiple ways to present yourself as groomed and well managed in a laid back environment.  

I eventually was able to flag someone walking by, and they told me that I was not in their section.   The next thing I know, a bartender shouted that she would be with me.  I was rushed to order cocktail.  Never offered any water, I had to get her attention again for the appetizer.  Meanwhile, she took more than enough time at every other table.  Carrying on light conversations and again conversing with other employees. 

 After 45 minutes, I decided that I would just leave.  I am cannot beg for a server to provide decent service.   I cannot believe I was at a restaurant for an hour to receive one cocktail and an appetizer.  I left and went to Bahama Breeze for dinner!  It was Amazing. Would highly recommend you avoid this place (Whiskey Joe's)  and go to Bahama Breeze if you want good food/cocktails, live music, and great service!

I will say that my Island Firecracker shrimp was delish, but not enough to suffer through bad service!"
zfUuE3lO23oAUWNQwysPmg,5,"I don't understand why this place has so many bad reviews. We were on our way to the stadium and we went to have a bite before the game. The views were amazing. The service was excellent and the food was very good. For appetizer we ordered the black bean hummus... it was delicious. My husband an I shared the sliders plate and my kids had the mahi nuggets, everything was really good. The parking is valet only, very convenient. Only $5. Would go back anytime."
FA5CtCnlxbpfhHPzGYR5_Q,4,"5 stars for the view.
3 stars for everything else. 

If you want to feel like you're on vacation- and enjoy the sunset- without fighting traffic to the beach- then head to Whiskey Joe's.  Take a seat on the outdoor patio for unparalleled views of the sunset....or cozy up to a bonfire on the beach.  

The food is OK- good, but overpriced. I've never had anything I didn't like here- but I've also never had anything that blew me away.  Wine and beer are reasonably priced- especially during happy hour. But expect to pay a little more for a boat drink.  

The indoor bar area is equipped with a lot of TVs- so it's a great place to watch a sporting event as well.  

I used to frequent Whiskey Joe's when I lived on Rocky Point- and went back there last week for the first time in a while for a friend's going away celebration. We had a lovely time chilling on the beach, huddled around a bonfire, telling stories and looking forward to the future!"
Byeeek1HASUkO-x45Ejg3g,3,"If you didn't have to order anything from servers, this place would get five stars. However, the service and food gets a 2 or a 3.   

It's an awesome location on the water with great views. They also have the ""barefoot bar"" on the beach outside. That's my favorite part. It hardly seems worth it to go inside. The service is extremely slow about 90% of the time and the food is...blah.  Great drinks and scenery totally make this place."
ONOBX3F1BsZFXgLqUbv-og,4,"Basically a drink review only.pulled right up on the beach on a pontoon boat with 6 people. Waitress jumped up with menus before we could even tie up the boat! Steak tacos and a bowl of soup ordered by 2. No complaints were heard. The drinks were served cold,often and fairly priced. Very good service slso"
qwQulbjfxjsAi8lzYoZMKQ,2,"I come here over and over, but it is only for the great outdoor patio and the views. The outdoor waitstaff has always been great. I've tried eating here many times and the food is not good. Poor quality and very basic. I am not even a great cook and can cook better than this place."
U9569AmylwrdJLpfR1U-Vw,4,"Good food, good service! Average bar food, excellent atmosphere. Relaxing and casual, the bar beach area is great for that! Great view from the restaurant area or beach are! 
Brought some out of town guests here for the very reason."
oGlEXahazztOPDkcZZJonA,1,Drinks  $9 to $12. Coconut margarita tasted horrible. Not mixed well at all. Other margarita flavors same issue. Not worth the money. You pay for the scenery. Get a beer in a bottle or can you cant mess that up. View is nice loud all dam night until 3am. Poor choice in music.
Bn1yHmmWsnEJKL7tTU6RBg,5,"Great food, great service, and beautiful views. Service was perfect, ample choices on the menu, and drinks were tasty."
0QaSE3dAUSIVjsYmuC3wgA,1,"Visited last week , the only thing that was good was the nachos appetizer , waitress forgot to even put in my soup order in and then gave it to me at the same time as my meal after I asked her for it three times . When I received my meal the chicken and rice were ice cold and the cheese sauce on my broccoli was like water . The other two meals in my party were not hot either , sangria was fine but the Bloody Mary's had no fixings and we watched two other tables served then with olives and the rest of the fixings which was disappointing . $110 not edible meal ."
5EDRdMOguwl2S0Dbk4W7Tw,4,"Loved our time here. Stopped in after the game and enjoyed the beach and outdoor area while we waited for our table. (They do take reservations.) We were seated at a table for 8. Ordered quickly and had our food in a decent amount of time given this place was jam packed! 

Staff was efficient and friendly. Food was great. Prices were fair given the area and ambience. Kid friendly."
Cr61T6itpPMjdquik-u8Fw,4,"One of the best beach bars in the Tampa area. You get a little bit of everything, whether it's areas inside with tons of TVs to watch sports on and a phenomenal view of the water from the windows covering 3 sides of the building or outside at the tiki bar right on the beach. Tons of variety when it comes to drinks and they have some great seafood options as well ( big fan of the house oysters). They do live music outside on a small stage most evenings and have jet ski rentals right next door as well."
F-NTEgYFo-bfZDJFHufAdA,4,"Madison, gets 4 stars, that helped us at the restaurant was great! But Catherine G. at the outside tiki area, when we asked for our check, she came back and fanned out 10 credit cards and asked ""Which one is yours?"", um she should have only asked what our name was on the card."
SZNlTLmy1nt8QQlM4vWk8A,5,The key lime pie is a must! Best damn key lime pie i have had!  Had the best services and nice view of the water.
mLS29MXYz9D1H2gjFQueRA,5,I really enjoyed this place. Great atmosphere. Sits right on the water. You can watch the sun go down amongst palm trees and the beach. The crowd is lively and a great place to watch games. The drink menu is solid and the food really good! I went with guava strawberry ribs and was not disappointed.
K2nMhg5LF7dB6Lik83KN2Q,3,"Great place to eart if you wanna be outside on the beach!

Gator bites-came with fried pickles...this whole meal tasted like fish...even the pickles..not much gator either, mostly pickles

Whiskey burger in paradise-it was good, i would try a different one if i get to visit here again."
Br5c0rglXcPI7e8nOuSgWg,5,This is a nice restaurant right on a nice little beach. Gets very busy... Great view of the water and Sunset. Really enjoyed the water and drinks. The staff was pleasant And really enjoyed our visit! Will definitely return again!
ERiK5eG6J1WMv00Aq1FHlA,2,Great location but consistently you will receive very poor service. It took them 25 min to tell me my beer I ordered was out. Then wait until it's time to pay.....good luck. Lol. Very very poor service.  At least they are consistent and you know it's going to be bad.
StKe3RMWZS2cu3xUOOU4lQ,2,"The sunset views were great, but that was about it tonight.

When we arrived we were told a 45 minute wait for a group of 7. I did not receive a text until 1 hour and 10 minutes later. After going to the hostess stand, they brought us to a table which another party was sitting out, which caused another 10-15 minute delay. Luckily the hostess was able to resolve the issue. Upon ordering our food, it took over an hour and every single meal came out cold. After arriving to a restaurant at 7 and not receiving meals until after 930 it was quite disappointing that everything came out cold. We were all too hungry to care and ate our meals anyway. Overall it was a disappointing night."
Pe1F_GjfJ6AsyTtWqQ4_fg,5,"Went here a few times during my two week stay in Tampa. Friendly staff, tasty food, and FANTASTIC brews!!!"
pq6KnFnFCTuhp6J3bts8nw,3,"I love the location and the drinks are great! However, the service near the beachside is horrible!  I say that because I was charged $173.30 for an order that was not mine. I had a $15 bill that was canceled after I signed and paid my check and left the restaurant! Wow! Don't pay with your card - I recommend paying only with cash for your bill if you sit out by the beachside! The staff is stressed by the crowds and our server actually lost a card from our party and in addition to the error mentioned above, she also charged another card in our party with four different checks! Crazy! Chris, the manager offered me a free appetizer and a drink on my next visit and says he's not charging me once the charges are reversed.  This is just a hassle! Is there not enough staff or is it a bad register system. Maybe consider getting iPads that the servers can use to cash folks out at the beachside instead of running back and forth. This makes me very concerned about returning! A check for $14 is very off from a check for $173!!! I'm still getting this mess cleared up with my bank!!! Beware- pay with cash only folks!!!

Also- be prepared to valet park for $5 and pay $5 (cash only) to get into the beachside area to order food and drinks."
HCrS2vaAI6ZnDWBLAX0aDQ,1,"Horrible service, food sucked & so did the personalities of every employee we came in contact with. When in Tampa/Clearwater again this place will be skipped."
StKHbUc7emF73Y2OoyUUmg,1,"Seated at beach table. No one came to offer us drinks or menus. My friend went to get menus and 20 mins after we still were NOT waited on! Poor customer service. Obviously they do not want our business. We are leaving now without having a drink, any food, and or ANY interaction with staff."
bE9KuFyKuD3zXKcd-aZ8qg,4,"Nice location. Great service. She was very attentive and sweet. Gave us great recommendations on what to order. The food was decent. Got the steak tacos, fries and coconut mahi nuggets. The fruit drinks were good. We were sitting outside facing the beach. Enjoying the cool breeze. We parked down the beach. We are after a day at the beach. It was nice that it was right off the beach so we didn't have to go far to eat. Def Check it out. Prices not bad. Def would come back if I'm in the area. The restaurant was clean and the bathrooms were too."
SSJgR1WTnDyJu2xgyHy72A,4,"Love this place! 
Casual, fun, good vibes beach bar/restaurant. 
My kind of place right by the water. Surprisingly never over crowded. Good drinks & food, nothing outrageous. I go for the atmosphere and the view.
Enjoy!"
otbM6kZTSUWHvMe1Hf07QA,1,My first experience at whiskey joes will be my last. The food was over priced and none of the six people at my party enjoyed their meal. We waited WAY too long for our drink order. The waitress was nice and did keep saying she was waiting for the bar to finish them. It was a Tuesday night and not busy. The appetizers came out before our drinks and the oysters were the smallest I've ever seen.
FP-C24Mi7VPqgZ6op3cC7Q,5,I came here on a trip to Tampa and I ate here on my very last night. I had the time of my life drinking virgin margaritas and playing corn hole in the sand. The pizza was pretty rad and I will come back on my next trip to Tampa
3nJkQ3h2eRZRe2CYqx-gRA,3,"I give this place 3 stars instead of 2 because the location is superb!  It's located on the causeway between several tourist hotels, not far from the airport highway, and the tackiest beach bar, Hulk Hogan's restaurant right there.  Chop House, Bahama Breezes are there too, so this is a tourist and conference epicenter which usually means that the food can be lower quality and higher priced.  

And this is case here.  Really.  It's always packed, you have to valet park, unless you want to pay & park at the near by beach.  The entrance has a tacky shop with t-shirts, hats, goo-ga with their logo.  It's very tourist.  

If you are a local, don't bother.  The drinks and food isn't worth the, admittedly, gorgeous sunsets.  The only reason I ever go here is when I have clients in town.  They have a hidden (if you don't know - you won't find it) bar and outside eating area on the beach.  There is a limited menu out there, but my clients' feet in the sand, playing corn hole and drinking beer, makes them happy.

Bottom line: mediocre food, crowded, touristy, high drink prices, pretty views."

Great grouper! Service wasn't great despite not being busy. It's a bit pricey for what it is. Great view of the bay!"
#NAME?,1,"Love this place for the outdoor beach bar... The amosphere is chill and good music when they have the reggae bands. 
However... if you want food or drinks forget about it. It literally took over 30 min just to get a drink at the outside bar. Totally unacceptable no matter how busy it was. Bartenders would just keep walking by and look away when they notice u trying to get their attn. There goes your tips. IJS 
Then we eventually found an open table but couldn't get someone to take an order for anything. One waitress just said I dont know,  I dont know what to tell you when I asked if or how we can place a food order. Then we finally got a waiters attention and he said they arent taking more orders. But its only 8:20 pm and u literally just took orders from 2 or 3 other tables near ours. 
And dont get me started on parking... It is valet only unless u park in the meter lot next to it. 
BUT that lot closes and gets locked up before the place closes. 
So if u do go be prepared for parking issues and horrible service. You need alot of patience to come here and really enjoy it.
We parked at Bahama Breeze and walked over cause it was just easier and didn't need to worry abt being locked in the meter lot again (yes this has happened to me before). I understand its a ""park"" lot or whatever but they know ppl are parked there for Whiskey Joes and should not lock it up till after the place closes. Or Whiskey Joes needs to add more parking somehow. 
Needless to say, we ate at Bahama Breeze after we left since Whiskey Joes wouldnt serve us. And we didnt want to eat inside the restaurant after the horrible service outside. 
Taking a break from here for a long long time."
6XC5JlitNBhBguXk-AAHXw,1,"Service and the view were the only decent things there. Yucky drinks, and dried up wings. Seriously over priced. $15 for 10 naked, dried and small wings. Way better choices around, don't go to Whiskey joes!"
ii4BF8IVqC_tsvn_jBw3Vg,5,COOL PLACE! Went on a Monday night and place was still pretty full. Got a nice table outside and watched the sunset. Burger (for me) and veggie pizza for my fiancé was terrific! After we walked on the beach right next door. If you're in the area this is a great place to go at night!
Ans280g0VfpD0JDLLdhWGw,2,"Im giving 2 starts because location is great.. but drinks were weak, food was average or below average.. service was extremely slow ! Our waitress would constantly disappear and then I would find her ""playing"" with her phone instead of helping out customers... she took FOREVER to bring drinks, food and our check ! Very frustrating... and also make sure u DONT use their valet service as they were also very slow and seem a little lost on whose car they were supposed to bring out... beach parking is right next to restaurant and easy to park and pay ! I really wanted to like this place because like I said here, the location its great.. especially for people from Tampa who dont want to drive all the way to overcrowded clearwater or St pete!"
xIcS7h0srh9Zops8gkdv8g,3,"View is amazing, and you actually have a good view of the water throughout the restaurant which is a huge plus.  Service was a little slow, but decent. The pork tacos are delish!  Husband said the burger was average.   A-ok for a casual lunch/dinner!"
PD1uUIAIwCZJgByhtR1j4A,4,"My husband and I really enjoyed our meal here.  We started with the nacho's, they were delicious!  And coming from Southern California, we're picky about our nacho's.  My husband got wings and I got a Caesar salad for our main course but we only ate about 1/4 of our meal, due to being so full from the nacho's.

When we walked in we were asked if we'd like to be seated indoors or out, we requested out.  The hostess asked another hostess, who was just standing there, if they had any available tables outside, she responded by hunching her shoulders and saying ""I don't know"".  Our hostess took us out there anyway and found us a table.  Our waiter was very young and seemed a bit inexperienced, he was attempting to take our plates and drinks away before we were finished.  But he was very polite and doing his best.  I had a Margarita on the rocks which was really good!  Great view of the water too."
iTuPO8F8vSXhwxqWBY5JmA,2,"Our waitress Madison was very helpful and knowledgeable with the menu, she was good with checking on us. We ordered the ribs, burger, wings, and the chips and queso, for drink we got the Miami vice. The food was not what we expected, maybe because we got here at 9:30 pm and on a Monday night. The ribs had loads of fat, the burger was dried, the wings had a weird after smell to it. The drink was delicious. Their fries is the best! 
We told our waitress and she took care of us immediately with the managers help. We will try it again but during the day time and not too close to closing time. The view is impressive!"
pDM90rF4qa7z-le2nmt3qQ,2,"I ignored the reviews. Wish I had not. This place was cool due to its location and the ambiance is cool. But seriously, that's where it ended. With so many places to choose from, I wish we had gone to lolis first. So much better food and insane that we paid 1/2 the price even after our meal was comped for tasting like crap (soggy fish that the birds ended up not even taking) yeah, won't be back."
bqCmrgMOZ2SqHVmnGnWGhA,4,"Five of us went here for dinner last Sunday after hanging out at Hogan's Beach. We spilt the nachos as an appetizer and they were the best I've had in a long time. I had the lobster and shrimp mac & cheese. It was pricey at $20, but worth every penny! I could only eat about a quarter of it after having some nachos, but it was just as delicious re-heated at home. The service was so-so, but the food more than made up for it."
_Ak8H72map-ybzVDodsk6Q,1,"Nothing to write home about. Would've ordered more had you seen me--a single, older woman with high disposable income--as a guest rather than an imposition. Forced to sit at bar with very poor service. ""Garden"" side salad is large portion but only yellowing iceberg lettuce. Black beans and rice (side) decent. The order and my tip would've been much larger had you found a way to seat me at a table and serve me."
jsCEyasr48l0ZULY0bgqzA,4,"What a great place to stop in for a quick bite and beautiful sunset before boarding my flight.  Really good food, and Marquis was an awesome server.  The drinks were a little pricey, but that's the norm for touristy areas. The outside seating is plentiful, as are the stunning views. Overall, we had a great experience, and I will definitely stop by and check it out again- expecially for a pre flight coctail and meal before traveling- it was just perfect!"
630KPWUI523f7wPBeiQtDA,3,Had wings and nachos they were both good. While waiting for a table to be available we sat at the bar. Took a while to get the bartenders attention and actually get a drink. Table service was much better. View of water is nice and good atmosphere outside.
OOJ45YSzPR6N0J-C1P8XZw,3,"My bf and I went here on a Sat evening around 8pm. The restaurant was semi-empty but there were lots of people at the Barefoot Bar. The bartenders were not very attentive because they didn't even notice us until about 5 min after we sat down. The first bartender asked if we were being helped, we said no, she took our order. Then a min or 2 later another bartender came by and asked if we were being helped. Throughout our stay we noticed that customers who sat down had to wait a long while before either bartenders even noticed they were there. At one point we needed to get another round but couldn't get anyone's attention. One bartender was talking to a group of guys more than paying attention to her customers; she was at the far end of the bar and had her back toward us so she couldn't see me waving my arm to get her attention.

The mixed drinks we ordered were good, the beers are reasonably priced, the music is good as always, being outdoors was nice, and we found out that we could drive our boat right up to the sand, but the bartenders really need to be more attentive to their customers.

I'm still giving the Barefoot Bar a 3 star because my experience didn't improve since my last review."
FFaiPAxtDEO8V8MpQb1cfQ,5,"Alcoholics Anonymous don't live here! Neither do I, but the selections are good but the store could use a little updating. It's kinda cool watching the ladies pull up in their Cadillacs with rollers in their hair at the convenient drive through window, (Werk it ladies!)  cool place!"
27yv8eYFyEpOmJVbcGcidg,1,"Rude staff. Nobody really seemed to go out of their way to offer assistance. I would cut them some slack because it is the busy season. However, the prices are pretty high for the mediocre food. If you want a good view of the bay then this is the place to be. Since I'm a local I think next time I'll just go to the bar and skip the restaurant."
pdZ8TsbKhu4zA7ASq1S3bw,3,"Very cool restaurant bar but food is average.  Fun place, nice waitstaff but we ate here 3 times, due to being at a hotel nearby for 12 days, and we tried many items.. Shrimp seafood pasta was the best choice, everything else was ok. Fun beach activities in the evenings. Fire pits, bands etc.  great party place......better for beach fun and drinks."
WVZle8n9jUUrldQZ0wN0jg,1,"Eating at Whiskey Joe's may have been the worst dining experience of my life. I stopped by with a few coworkers after work on a nice evening. We were staying at a hotel nearby, so we figured we would go get a few drinks and eat dinner on the water and see the sunset. When walking up to the restaurant, it looks like a good time (nice location on the water with some beach seating)..... boy were we tricked - It was like a mirage.

First off, one of our menus had a band-aid on it. We should have known right then and there to RUN AWAY, but we stayed......We ordered a bunch of things off the menu, calamari, queso dip, and mussels for appetizers; burgers and chicken for dinner; kept it real simple. The only food that was edible was the queso, which shouldn't be surprising since it probably came out of a velveeta can. Do NOT order the calamari - Out of the whole basket, there were probably 5 pieces of small calamari; the rest of the basket was filled with fried sour onions that were shaped to look like calamari, such trickery! The mussels came out an HOUR AFTER the first two appetizers, along with the rest of the meals. The mussels were COLD and had a chewy/tacky consistency. I ate like 4 and almost barfed. I was done at that point. The burgers were also cold and extremely under-cooked. The chicken was covered in so much fried batter, it is probably healthier to eat chicken fingers from McDonald's. 

Now for the service, the entire meal took about 2.5 hours for some simple appetizers and entrees. The restaurant was not even packed. We were barely checked on, and when we were, the waitress asked about the mussels (since we barely touched them) and then immediately said she was leaving and someone else would take over our table. Like K THANKS. 

To top it off, we were seated right behind the outside bar. There was a woman seated at the bar SMOKING and was blowing smoke into our table and food, so that was extremely appetizing also. I would think that even though they have an outdoor bar/dining section, you should still have to go elsewhere to smoke, away from other diners. Isn't that some sort of health code violation?"
Zy6AkTkM5pflaEzk_lpvrA,3,"They close REALLY EARLY but other than that it's a typical bar with a relaxed atmosphere.  They were having some sort of party on the beach while we were there, so we couldn't check it out, but hanging out in the bar was fun with good service and music."
1SMRDDmEfAF-1zICeEG0Aw,5,"After walking into the beach part, we sat at a table and waited a minute before we flagged down a waitress that said she would be back in a second, 5 mins of sitting in the sun with no drink in hand. We got up to get our own drinks from the bar. A while later after our drinks were over we spotted another female waitress and asked her to come and help she did with no hesitation and a big smile. Her name is Nikki, we asked for drinks and she promptly came back with our shots and beer, with the best attitude that warmed our hearts! I write this still sitting here under this beautiful sun, enjoying the drinks/ day that Nikki made so much better! She is a jewel. You have quite an asset with her! As long as shes here, we will be sure to come back!"
IJNamJUTHSLUm8ZPnWpBUQ,3,"This is a review for Whiskey Joe's Barefoot Bar, which is located on the same property as Whiskey Joe's. 

Follow the wooden walkway left of the main building of Whiskey Joe's to where the sand meets the water, that's where you'll find the Barefoot Bar. The floor surrounding the bar is cement, but just a foot or 2 from your chair is all sand. Barefoot Bar offers a full bar and a full food menu. It also has excellent happy hour for drinks. Nearby is a stage. The area in front of the stage is filled with high tops and chairs, all of which is on sand. I believe there's live music Fri-Sun. Between the bar and the water, which is about 40-50 feet away, a few tables with umbrellas that looks like top of a tiki hut are scattered around, which keeps you cool and makes you feel like you're in the tropics. There are also 2 fire pits, to provide ambiance and warmth, if needed.

My friends and I ordered beer, the Whiskey Joe's Calamari (calamari strips, beer battered with peppers and zucchini, served with chipotle mayo) and the Steak Rockets (tender and juicy garlic herb marinated steak, caramelized peppers, onions and cheddar jack wrapped in an egg roll wrapper, served with avocado ranch). The calamari was pretty good, except I feel like the peppers and zucchini are fillers (less calamari). I assume the Steak Rockets were delicious because my friend at the entire thing.

Overall, the atmosphere here is pretty festive and beachy. I think Barefoot Bar is good for happy hour and Fri and Sat evenings if you live in Tampa and are too lazy to drive all the way to the gulf for sand and sunset."
NjXZtJoxRfyDeMOactsXhg,3,"This place is a very cool place to enjoy a good meal. It's off the water, you can request to sit outside but it was a bit breezy for our liking. Parking is by valet, otherwise you have to park on beach and pay to park. That being said, number one rule, always tip valets as you get your car back. 
The food was good, not out of this world good but decent. The reasons I gave this restaurant 3 stars are one,  you cannot simply rely on location. The food has to be timed when brought out, fish should not be salty, wait staff do need to act at least interested, and prices should match quality rather than quantity. 
Offering valet service should give off the sense that you do serve fantastic food, not just okay food. 
Interior reminds me of a fishing lodge, which doesn't go with the beautiful scene outside. It's mix and matching, a bit odd, but I would give it another shot if I was that way."
vNU3hflE6JW7VaUazvdadA,5,"We throughly enjoyed our experience at Whiskey Joes for lunch..we decided to sit inside because it was a little windy outdoors.  Our service was very attentive and THOSE VIEWS, just wow.  We had a party of 4 and everyone enjoyed it.  We tried the alligator for an appetizer,  yummy.  I will most definitely be back."
bJQc4iBEpKn3jxb43PpAAg,5,On a mini vacation with my man. Came here for a quick bite to eat and some beers to start off our trip. Definitely didn't disappoint! Excellent food. Bartender (Frank I think!!) was awesome! We sat at the outside bar. He was very sweet. Answered all our questions regarding the local beers and local hot spots. Very attentive. Great spot to watch the sunset also!!!! We got there around 6 and we had an excellent view of the water with the sun setting over it. Def a nice chill spot. Weekends are definitely more lively. We went on a Monday and it still wasn't dead. Great Tampa spot. So happy we stopped!!!!
#NAME?,1,"My friend and I had lunch here and the food was ok. The problem started when we asked for separate checks and we each gave our credit cards to the waiter. When he came back to the table he informs my friend that their registers will not take a card without a chip and that she needs to use their ATM to get cash for payment. When I received my statement I saw where he charged me for her lunch and he took her cash! Basically gave himself a $32 tip. When we took our receipts back to the manager he literally said ""This waiter has been here a long time and gets confused with credit cards and he didn't mean to do it""  What? Beware and check your credit card statements if you go here."
AXRA89kwYhcxDNNQgWyxZg,1,Be careful when buying specialty drinks. Server doesn't tell you price and when your bill comes you're suddenly paying $30 for one drink. Even though I tripled checked the price with my server. Bill came out way more than expected. Also rude about it.
E2IY6RTPy8pm-YEro1JK2g,1,Wow the other reviews are right! The foods is horrible especially on the outside bar area. The grouper sandwich was soooo bland and expensive. The fish tacos had 1 piece of fish in each shell. The fish tacos should be called coleslaw tacos because they were just filled with shredded lettuce and cans of corn and a sardine sized completely over salted fish.I didn't even eat the tacos after 2 bites and my husband forced down the bland grouper sandwich. Althogether the hossible meal and 1 pitcher of beer came up to 50 bucks SMH! Also we ordered a pitcher of corona and we swear it wasn't corona that they gave us but like a coors or miller.
Kp8ZSdy13Y3jzl4kPTDGwA,1,"Went there for lunch. Poor service. Amy behind the bar should quit. Walked past my empty glass 10 times with out looking to see its empty. She said I should say something, I told her she is the bartender and the place is dead so I shouldn't have to say anything. But the regulars beside me were getting asked every 5 min if they were good by 3 different people. Even after she rolled her eyes at me I still tipped 5 on 16. She is past her prime and tries way to hard to look good to the point it's sickening. And as another review says, porky girls that wear way short shorts with nothing but cellulite hanging out and pulling them out and down to cover while seating people then handding them menu's after pulling it out of her crotch."
Hreww0WbQzey6tdD1M8FjQ,5,"I travel a lot for work and these are the best wings that I have ever had by far. I am not crazy about the south but boy, you sure can't beat the food! I had the Buffalo and the jerk wings. I couldn't get enough! Service was great and other foods were really good too. If my travels bring me to Tampa again, this is definitely a must go to."
Zeh-p8dRnvBnA_8sEmso9A,3,It was ok.. probably won't be back. We were craving a grouper sandwich and it was nothing special. Plenty of other places with better grouper sandwiches. Also had a frozen daiquiri that was basic just like every where else. The server was sort of awkward too. Probably his first serving job.
Kz3Bjpkx4ymQCLXE5TwjqA,5,Whiskey Joe's is an amazing restaurant! I truly enjoyed myself! Whiskey Joe's is located right on the water and offers great views! The food and drinks were great! The food came out fast and hot! Pictures speak for themselves please take a look to get a better idea. I ordered the Jamaican Whitefish and my wife ordered the Swashbuckler Basket! We also tried the firecracker shrimp and the fried gator with fried pickles. Whiskey Joe's has great customer service. They even offer valet parking. Definitely recommend giving this place a shot and take 1 while you're at. ;-)
tflIQKoEBSMqRxBGYIrBjg,5,The firecracker shrimp tacos were delicious!! Love the seasoning on the tortilla chips! Will definitely come back.
3EoMPXZYrgbun5XwYGPjeQ,2,"Atmosphere is wonderful, but don't go for the food, at least not for anything blackened - cook does not know the difference between blackened fish and poached fish.  Bleh, sent it back and he sent it right back out as it was.  Seriously??? We usually take company here when they come to visit - looking for a new place!"
tRAJuljV1uVzEC78PsLnGg,1,OUCH - Valet guys were total jerks - was supposed to have another lunch meeting there this week but cancelled reservations and won't be back again with the way the valet guys handled themselves. This is even before getting in the door for a mediocre meal.....
MMK5KIyXpobqMaE43HlgLQ,5,"Excellent service, view and food. Pile of nachos was so big, we were satisfied eating that and our side salads. Priced right , We will definitely be back."
GIZXXpCtsemQlMR0cDIz0Q,1,"Dang. Really regret not listening to other reviewers 
My bf and I just left there after speaking to the manager. He comped our meal. 
First off, the staff wasn't sure what was on the menu if u ate outside as opposed to inside. We went to see a reggae band play and sat outside which seemed nice enough but I ordered water and wanted to look at the beer list, 20 mins later the server came back and I ordered a beer then she came back that it wasn't available. We ordered food which had all the wrong toppings not to mention it was gross. We got shrimp and sausage quesadillas but they were salad shrimp and what tasted like hot dog! quesadillas. They came w a chipotle mayo which was hot. Like warm, like warmer than room temp. We also ordered steak tacos w the chimichurri sauce on the side. The sauce was on the side and the coleslaw which was bitter! The ""carne asada"" was dried out meat. So it was literally meat on a tortilla. Nothing else. No lettuce, tom, chz. Dry. Granted we didn't want their sauce. We got none of the house made salsa which was supposed to come with it. We couldn't wait to get out of there and will NEVER be going back. There's more I could write but I'm at my next destination."
8YCRHjMX_QNyiBtVCJrfcw,5,We were suppose to drive to clearwater beach and saw this place from the road so we decided to stop. Best decision we ever made. It was the first of many. There's a beach here so bring your swimsuit. The food is great and the drinks are awesome. The service is great as well.
dIhu8kNelZZqyT9Q0AF8oQ,2,"Friday evening Parking was decent Got a great table with a view! Ordered artichoke and crab dip! Woof! The. The chips tasted like I was eating an ashtray! Next! Ok I ordered the chopped salad! If you don't like spicy or cayenne pepper Don't order the salad or ask to omit it! I couldn't even eat it But the waitress took it off the bill for us! Food was so so But views were great, if that makes up for the food quality I am not sure!"
sjpMpeE6EtnHeeZrOCRf2w,1,"OVERRATED... Ok, don't get me wrong... It probably gets tons of visitors because of it's location with a view but folks possibly can't be going here for the service and the food. Customer service was super slow and they were not even busy. Food, well nothing to write home about. I asked what people at there, bartender recommended the Grouper Sandwich or tacos... We I wasn't coming all the way to Florida for tacos when I get the real deal in Cali... That Grouper Sandwich was sad... Super dry, pitiful portion of fish served with a HUGE bun. Fries were decent but I'm not trying to come just for the fries. As for the bar... Well all the specialty drinks come out of a margarita machine and had a 711 Slurpee texture... All the alcohol must've been left in the machine cause it was WEAK! Oh, and that bar had tons of bugs flying around as well... Won't be back."
_IGKycUm6mFT7RYCCyqirQ,5,"Wow, just left here. All parking at bar is now valet, dude came running after us to let us know. Only other parking is beach parking which you will also pay for. We live in Ft. Myers and loved this place, but I think I'll find other places to love now. Paying for the ""pleasure"" of eating at your establishment is just not my thing. A little like being held hostage,don't ya think? It is 5:00 p.m. on a Monday night, snowbird season over. Seriously??? 

Just recieved an answer to the above review that explained the parking situation better. Wish the guy who chased after us would have explained this to us, so I have changed my review to reflect that I am the one who misunderstood. We love this restaurant, food is great and ambiance is fun. Now that I know I can park there, all is right with the world. A big thank-you to Whiskey Joe's for caring enough to respond."
8au2MX5FflP1277pocMlGQ,2,"ATMOSPHERE: This place is right on the water so the views are great! We sat inside because it was a little chilly. There are fire pits on the beach you can sit around. I don't know if they have food service out there though. They also have a deck over the water but of course it was super crowded. Inside, the place is a little dark, but cozy. There are nice small aquariums around to make you feel like you're at the beach. Also, there are some nice places to walk along the beach after dinner. You don't even need to move the car! They have valet, too. 

CUSTOMER SERVICE: Customer service is just okay. Our waitress was obviously upset to be working on her birthday, she even mentioned it a few times. But never the less, she kept a smile. They were nice but didn't really have good customer service skills. Our drinks were never refilled the whole time but they never hesitated to sell you on alcohol. We were here for about TWO hours, just to eat dinner. We had a small mishap, but for not being very busy, our food took FOREVER. It took forever because they ask you what you want to drink. Then they bring that. Then once you've had a second to look at the drink menu, they take your alcohol order. Then that takes 15 minutes or so. Then they come back for your appetizer or food order. But it was a good 25 minutes after we sat down that we could finally order. Our food took about 45 minutes even tho it wasn't crowded. This leads me into the food. 

FOOD: I ordered the white sand pizza which is basically an Alfredo pizza with chicken, spinach, and artichokes. The pizza came and it seriously looked like a tortilla with Alfredo sauce. Thin crusted is a serious understatement. It was crunchy and fell apart pulling it apart. The pizza was so bland. I couldn't taste anything. The chicken tasted like frozen chicken and was perfectly grilled and sliced. Obviously from a frozen bag of chicken. So I ordered a burger. Man- this burger was delicious. It was just their signature burger. Definitely order it. I'm not even a big burger person but this one was amazing. Also, it doesn't matter what you order, make sure you order fries. I don't know what they do to make them so yummy! And I'm not a huge fan of coleslaw either but it came with the burger so I tried it. Gosh. Even that was delicious. My sister ordered the mac and cheese with crab and shrimp. That was okay. Crab was good but completely minced up to the point where we thought it was breadcrumbs. Also, the sauce for the mac and cheese was definitely out of a can or box. But other than that it was alright. We also ordered dessert. The cheesecakes were obviously bought elsewhere and not made in house. They don't have a desert menu so you just have to make a desision based on how your waiter describes it. Ours did a terrible job but we were craving sugar so we ordered the mud pie and cheesecake anyway. I absolutely hate coffee flavored chocolate. Our waitress just said it was a chocolate mousse pie. I feel like she had never even freaking SEEN it before. It was like a bag of Oreos had exploded over a piece of cheesecake. The cheesecake was NOT chocolate. I don't even know what it was supposed to be. But the crust was Oreo and it had like 10 Oreos smashed up over the entire plate. The worst part was that the whole thing tasted like coffee. Gross. Don't order the mud pie unless you like coffee flavored Oreos. 

We probably won't come back unless it's a nice day since the location is so nice."
rlWK4001xKWV1xpksOl1TQ,4,Came in for happy hour w a group from the office. Can't beat the atmosphere and location on the water. Had drinks and appetizers and our waitress Amy did a great job. Recommend her and Whiskey Joes.
ro1JWA4GFS9a7YKz-EqfDA,4,"This place is perfect to watch the sunset and enjoy the evenings next to warm bonfire pits. The servers are sweet (most of the time) and they have peanuts to grab and snack on while waiting for your order. The only reason I didn't give this place 5-stars is because their food quality could definitely be better and fresher. If you're looking for the most bang for your buck, go during Happy Hour. From 4-7 pm they have kinds of amazing cocktails and for food; the nacho appetizer is Huge! Definitely big enough to split."
KQXINsmXSgSItpbbTFCWWg,4,"I always look forward to my yearly visit to Whiskey Joes.  The place is always busy.  Great food, good drinks.  Service can be hit or miss but lucked out this last time, sat in the bar area and had a great server.  It took a bit but once she got to our table it was fine. 
Great bay and sunset views!!!"
mbfTItJ44fPQpt3n-fJ45A,4,I've been coming to whiskey joes for the past 5 years. The food is delicious. I love the seating area outside above the water. It's a breathtaking view and convenient bar up there. The outdoor beach bar area is always a blast!!! They have live music on certain nights and a great vibe. They should stop serving bottles in this area because I've ran across broken glass in the sand. The fire pits are wonderful this time of the year. This is a great Sunday fun day spot. The only thing I really really dislike is the lack of parking. Thank goodness for complimentary valet!!
1otClvyejzD4zg9UnoscDg,3,"We had dinner there shells and muscles was ok ,salmon i recommend. Services was a little Missy unorganized.
They have an amazing beach bar area and one of the best sunset spots a must see sunset."
bTGxcv0NJEAIkdJ59PSgfg,4,Grateful for the view and the food had the coconut chicken and it was awesome. Would be back as soon as I return to the area
e75fohxxf2NIWiVzj3j9rw,4,"My 1st Time there, visiting from
Pittsburgh! It was alright!! I really liked our waitress, Tracey!! She was very personable & attentive!! Thank you for the Great Service!"
Ogk5DAXvBM_7dvF546uPkg,5,"Great ribs, cold beer and a friendly staff. That's about all you can ask for when a place is already sitting on the water so you can watch the sunset."
BaB5du7d05vJ3XvHvuB4pQ,4,"I don't even remember what sandwich I ordered. It was alright. But the fries! They were perfect. I would go there just for the fries.
We sat outside on the deck- very nice view."
#NAME?,1,"Drinks are average. Staff is one of the worst I have experienced. Waited for an hour for food that the bartender never put in and ended up leaving because it would have taken over 2 hrs for nachos. I would not suggest this place to anyone who has any experience working in the service industry. To say the least in a city that bars like this are common, don't waste your time here."
fz_qvKeGWt-NDNRmngHf6Q,3,"A little touristy for my tastes.  Food is alright, but the main attraction is the view.  Love the outdoor seating."
VlhEIggyRhE5hQaZY-oqGg,1,"If I could give zero stars I would. Seated for lunch on a Tuesday(today). Moderate crowd, no wait, two in our party. Seated for 15-20 min and no one ever came to our table. Nothing. Not even a ""I'll be with you in a minute"". We left, but stopped by the hostess area to let someone know. Get it together - that's Restaurant 101. Easy stuff. Won't be back. Of course."
gf8odKOgFIGkPkrRR7XnAw,1,I just had an awful experience here. I arrived with some family members and requested to sit outside. All the tables were taken but we were assured that we were the only ones waiting. We waited 30 minutes and three other families were seated ahead of us outside even though 3 of the employees all knew we were waiting. My wife told the hostess we were leaving because others were being seated outside ahead of us. Instead of apologizing she said that she was about to seat us and gave us a very sarcastic bye on the way out. Very disappointing :(
Xlx7orp9ypcaszbIOb1r4A,1,Horrible - don't bother - took a party of 7 3 1/2 hrs to complete our meal - worst service ever.  We had to get our own plates for our apps - server either too lazy or too stupid.
vp3Nm-YjMmeOuX5_BSg2fQ,4,I am giving this 4 stars not for food but atmosphere.  Amazing!  Live music outside on the beach with gorgeous fire pits and a large bar outside.  I ordered a couple of appetizers and they were typical bar food but I was many really there to eat!  Great place great times!
GrkmwNi_M9RAxpT6umTUJQ,5,"This is my second time at Whiskey Joe's. 
First, I will say that the location and atmosphere is almost unbeatable. The service is awesome, too. We sat in the bar with the bartender, Scott, who is really great. Other servers and staff were also friendly and welcoming. As for the food, the shrimp tacos were so good the first time I came, I had to get them again. We also got the queso dip which was so tasty. Also- get the Skinny Margarita!!!! Will definitely return on our next visit to Tampa."
xTwXr7xaIV9Rwzv7th6p4g,3,"This place is one of my favorite happy hour hangouts in Tampa. It has one of the best sunset views in the city. They even have a private beach next to the restaurant with live music and a bar. It would be nice though for them to regularly clean the beach from plastic cups and beer cans. The outdoor sitting area is also very nice. The service is slow but ok.
The big drawback of this restaurant is its food.... If the owner would have better food quality and a better food menu, he/she would be a millionaire by now! It is almost a sin that they don't improve the food menu and the food quality. I only go to this place for drinks, and I would only ask for food if I'm desperately hungry.
Message to the owner - improve the food menu please!"
5qPDKOZRUq9vKG4WHekktg,3,"Good beach bar and beach party atmosphere but the food I ordered was not very good. I ordered the fish tacos and the fish was tough and tasted very fishy. It doesn't tell you on the menu what the fish is and I should have asked before, but when I asked after they said it was pollock. For a Florida place on the water they should not go cheap and instead do Grouper. Especially since it's $12 for two tacos. Disappointed."
7AQCCVeE22_qb6mOxOxOfA,4,"Great restaurant. I had the grouper sandwich which was execellant and the wife also enjoyed her jerked chicken sandwich. The waiter was very friendly and checked on us every two to three minutes. The view at this place is also excellent.
 
I would definitely recommend this place to all looking for a great dinner wiith a view"
3tkJq9wgGU3kok7_d-q2ig,1,"I went here about 5 years ago and I remembered it being good so I decided to try it again.  Ugh.  We sat down and not 1 person acknowledged us.  We waited about 15 mins to put in our drink order...we should've just left then.   We ordered 2 appetizers..and we were gonna order more but after waiting 30 mins to get chips with queso we couldn't believe our 2nd appetizer never came out.  The queso was cold, not melted at all so we just asked the waitress to pop it in the microwave for us real quick bc we were starving. We finished the chips and still no wings....she came back about 15 mins apologizing for the wait.  We are currently still here waiting for the wings(20 mins after we finished the I wish we could just get our check and leave.  I don't even want them anymore.


Updated----she came back after another 10 mins and said we were 3rd in line!  Ummm what?!?  We just got our check and left.  The place was NOT even busy.   Very bad service...such a shame bc the location is so pretty.  Hopefully it changes ownership again"
eJaTXIUksLsKR_9JLz4YeA,5,"This place gets a 5 for atmosphere and the sunset. I completely agree with the other reviewer who said the views make the average food taste better. But I'm not even going to write about the food. That's not why you go here.

If you're having a crappy day, this is where you need to come. I crashed my car about a year ago, came here, had two mango margaritas, watched the sunset, and I forgot all about my car. It  probably helped that the Tampa Bay Parrotheads were having a meetup and a bunch of drunk 50-somethings were doing a conga line through the restaurant. 

This is the best view of the sunset in Tampa. Sit out on the deck, grab a fancy drink, and brace yourself for the reason I moved to the West coast: the unbelievable sunset.

They also have a tiki bar on their ""beach"" with live music. The sand itself is kind of nasty, so it's best to keep your shoes on. If you can't make it for the sunset, the next best thing is to sit out at the beach bar on a nice day."
4kI03BdavNxoekdnvLa9RA,1,"Slimy shrimp,slimy gritty oysters =this place sucks!!!

Way to EXPENSIVE.
I will never stop here again!!!"
Nnjm4KUMX0i-nIXC3uFPyA,5,"Came on a Saturday night with a large party and was told a 2 hour wait. They are a very busy place!! We went down to the beach and had some drinks until it was our turn for dinner. (You can also order food at the beach but is an abbreviated menu and we wanted the full menu). So two hours came and went and we went to check on the status and were told 2 more hours wait. Well sorry that wasn't going to work for me, double the wait time we were told. So I asked to talk to a manager since our party patiently waited 2 hours. All was solved when they offered our party the private room that is usually rented out! We got to all dine in the private room for free which I really appreciated! After that the food and drinks were amazing! I don't remember what I had to drink but I had the quesadilla and mussel appetizers, they were good and everyone else was also satisfied with their food. Thank you for accommodating us!"
KanFdAvVjAWU-VoVpfWmDQ,4,"Invited by a friend to just chill and relax!  Sat outside and had a great view of the water the problem is that it's too hot! My suggestion is for them to put a fan outside! 

Nevertheless the food was good I ordered the new England clam chowder,  and the gator bites! And had a Margarita drinks! Just nice to have a drink sit outside and enjoy the view!

My first time to visit this place and will come and visit again to try some other dish that they have!"
C6DiyRzJRdm91UEm1w_x9w,1,I live very close and should be a regular but I'm not because I consistently get terrible service. I was a bartender for 15 years so I'm always patient and friendly with bartenders and staff. One bartender in particular always has a scowl on her face. They act like you're bothering them when you order a drink. I've even tipped great hoping they'd change their attitude but it's the same every time so I frequent Bahama Breeze where the bartenders are quick and friendly.  This opinion is mostly for the bar outside on the sand. It's a shame because the location is great. I haven't been there in about 6 months but I've been going there for 6 years and it's been the same.
ZzMheUlKEuX8aQeOy9uNag,5,"At first, we were going to go to a restaurant across the street at 5pm on a Sat. When we arrived we were told the wait time for a party of 5 adults 2 kids and a baby was at least 90 minutes. I called Whiskey Joe's and spoke to the manager Nick who informed me that he could throw some tables together for us and fit us in that very minute. We drove right over and the place was packed and on a wait. True to his word Nick had us sat right away and we had an amazing meal and a fantastic time. I can not recommend this place enough and will definitely be back purely for the service we received.
Ps. The carnitas were amazing."
IRf0LgvoEBa56AfewJt5DQ,2,"The view is great.  But everything else is average at best.  The food is typical beachy, touristy, bar food.  As for the drinks...they were out of three beers that we wanted.  The Coronorita we finally received tasted like orange juice, the cocktails barely had any alcohol, and the limes for our cervezas were all dried out.  This list makes us sound like alcoholics, but we sent back the coronarita, only had one beer, and there was no alcohol in the mixed drinks..."
AVrpIcBPwY8nFyRst9joTA,2,"It was ok. My husband and I split a big kahuna pizza and a whisky burger in paradise for our meal and ordered the gator bites for an appetizer. The pizza was pretty good but it was a little dry.  The gator bites were tasty and cooked well. The burger sucked. We ordered it medium and it was well done and dry. The grilled pineapple was canned tidbits. Come here for the drinks. The outdoor bar is fun, right on the water and reasonably priced."
juYgNaLNxWODQ6g1Z4PpxA,5,"Whiskey Joe's is good. Typical bar with typical barfood. I wouldn't trust the oysters unless it's a ""R"" month who knows where they get them from."
2bIzHyzW5DSXZ3VUO-3_RQ,5,"Right off the bat I knew I would like the menu at Whiskey Joe's solely based on their drink selections! The mojitos were absolutely delicious and refreshing while we sat on the second story patio overlooking the bay. The food went above what you'd expect from a seaside bar & grille. Definitely get the mussels! The view itself is worth every penny.

After lunch we mozied down to the beachside tiki bar where you could lay in lounge chairs, sit under a tiki umbrella, play cornhole, swim, etc. This spot was really cool! I would definitely recommend Whiskey Joe's!"
lElybzMaMwYP6fOp9C7qMA,4,"Went on a Saturday afternoon, view and food were good. Either you have to valet or pay to park on the adjacent lot. Knocked a star off as we waited for a bout 15 minutes after we sat down for someone to give us a menu and take a drink order and they were not at all busy."
2DSX5vHyyGwG5nOk5asGAg,2,"As others have said, great location... fantastic view and beach setting... food is good for a bar and grill... only to have it all ruined by just abysmal service at the tiki bar beach area. 

I sat at a high top table on the beach area, and never once had a server come to the table. Not. One. Time. So after waiting for about 20 minutes, I continued to walk up to the bar to order each drink. And then to order dinner about 45 or so minutes after sitting there with drinks. I ordered a burger, which was very good, but was told to come back up to the bar in ""about 10 minutes"" to pick it up. Confused by the service procedure, as I was sitting at a high top not 10 steps from the the bar with two wait-staffers walking right passed me literally the entire time I sat there, I obliged. Walked back, set a timer on my phone for 10 minutes, and waited. Alarm goes off, I walk up to the bar again, ""oh, I guess it's not ready yet it'll be just a few more minutes."" She says. I told her  ""no problem, I'll just keep walking back up to the bar every few minutes to check and see if it's ready."" ""Okay!"" She says... more confused than ever, I ask, ""do you guys have wait staff for the beach table areas?"" ... ""yeah, there should be somebody out there."" She says. Confused as could possibly be and starting to get pretty fed up, I walk back to my table and set a timer for 10 more minutes, walked back to the bar, the burger was ready and had been sitting on the counter behind the bar waiting for me to come back and pick it up. Picked it up, took it back to the table, ate, walked back to the bar to pay and left. 

I must say, everyone at the bar I interacted with was very friendly when you got their attention, they just seemed incredibly oblivious to anything that was going on until you got their attention. It was honestly a truly mind boggling restaurant experience. 

I would say it is worth stopping in and trying it out, as the view and beach atmosphere truly is amazing. Just be prepared to be incredibly patient, confused, and do most of the service work yourself."
do7BdetKJuHOP1_r4-w0Kg,2,"My fiancé and I were looking for a relaxed place to grab a quick seaside bite before checking into our hotel, and he has always wanted to try Whiskey Joes. The parking lot was a disaster, but we happened to snag a close spot. No problem getting an outside table (was a Sunday around 6:30 pm in March). Great! Quick seating. However, once seated the atmosphere was dirty and we were underwhelmed. There are tables overlooking the water, but we moved to one under the bar roof area bc it was windy and cold, and afraid it was about to rain. It took FOREVER to get our food, and it wasn't that busy. The food was similar to a chain such as Applebee's. I ordered the mussels, and the sauce was way too salty and buttery. My fiancés shrimp tacos were average. Dirty floors with trash and food on them. The only good thing was that the servers were very nice. Won't be coming back though."
CXtP3dGzQhg5_Wv_pXjKQQ,3,"This is one of those places that always seems to have a full parking lot when I drive by, which generally speaks well of a place. When I stopped by last week the parking lot was packed as usual, but people were starting to leave since the dinner rush was over, so I was able to get a seat out on the deck immediately. The sun had set, but I could tell from what was left in the sky that it had been a spectacular view. There's also a little beach park right near the outside deck. I'm guessing the beach and the view of the bay (and perhaps the bar, which seemed like it could get hoppin') are the reasons the parking lot gets packed, because the food was very disappointing. 
It's hard to judge a place based on one meal, but I picked a few relatively simple items and what came out to my table was pretty unappetizing. The ""world famous"" fries are a step or two below McDonalds', the Ahi Tuna sliders had just a tiny piece of tuna and the Hawaiian bun hadn't been grilled like it was advertised, etc. 

I can see going back to watch the sun set and have a couple drinks sometime, but probably not if I'm hungry."
rm8EUgK5AI-kTU8RLgjiUw,1,"Very nice restaurant and awesome water front 
But the worse SERVICE  ever and food mediocre to say at best.
If I could I would give it -5  for the really poor service provided for their customers."
hhqeuCztCVEwwwH26EoYbw,5,"I have been here 4 times for me to go to the same place 4 times when there are so many different resturants to visit they are doing something right! I always get the shrimp and oysters as an appetizer it is wonderful the shrimp are huge and the oysters clean (cocktail sauce horseradish and lemon) FRESH!!!!! I have had the pirate's chest or fisherman's chest (i forget what they call it)it's all of the fried seafood fried fish, scallops shrimp, delicious with fries Krispy and fresh.  The waitress suggested the fish tacos I never had fish tacos before 1st time I ever tried them it was fresh! it was delicious  and fresh.  I have since tried other places and they did not measure up to the ones I had at Whiskey Joes  I will go back there again just for those . the scenery is beautiful the drinks are on point the staff are friendly and kind and very accommodating.  You May wait a little bit but it's worth it at-least check them out once and besides the patio and the inside bar there is a beach side haven't been there yet but I hear there are fire pits and it is fun I will be checking that out soon too!"
g8LLuheKu6g03PsOrnniUQ,1,I was excited it seemed cool but I sat at the bar outside for about 3-5 min and saw 2 girls behind the bar and I understand when someone is busy but they walked by me a dozen times and not even a hi or I'll be right with you or anything. Then they asked the guys next to me if they wanted to order food... hmmmm. I must be invincible. After sitting for a while left. What a bummer. Off to the next bar instead.
Kgh1b91PaT7kzFIXRWqmfw,2,"Food was okay. We had to sit inside because of the weather and the place smelled like urine, badly. Service could of been more attentive. We had our son with us and it took about 10 minutes to get drinks on the table and she took about another 10 minutes to check on us after we received our meal. Only good thing about this place is the view and valet."
4F0mL171324IP11gwwmzqg,3,Beautiful views. Horrible service. Average food. Go for some drinks hang out with some friends watch the sunset. And don't expect anything else. Tried it three separate times over a year every time I got ignored and had bad service.
nPDAE0MJlxcf2AAksc_CYA,3,"Whiskey Joe's has a beachy atmosphere and great view, however their food is average. I had the grouper sandwich during my last visit and it tasted pretty fishy. Their tiki beach is a cool place to hang out and have a drink though."
rkuYWX6itOaYa4W5msD-5Q,3,The tiki bar has a great location and is one of my favorite places to grab a drink near the water.  Downside is service is typically pretty bad and the food outside at the tiki bar is mediocre at best. Come to drink near the water and people watch but expect to wait for drinks and eat elsewhere.
Ks1On3C1X84N6IQ9_47srA,4,I went here during the 4th of july weekend and this place was definitely packed!  The views are amazing and the drinks were good.  I had this cucumber margarita drink with jalapenos which sounds really weird but it was quite refreshing.  The shrimp tacos were really good but the fries had too much seasoning on them.  We had to send them back because the salt overload was too much.  The second batch was good.  Our waiter was cool too... i forgot his name but he was super nice. I would definitely go back...
FVElC6lO-WKuhZMff8JnwA,5,"Once again because my son who is in love with the coconut rum wings, we were back at Whiskey Joe's to further explore the menu.  We started with the so addictive wings, since hubby is out of town for business we decided to enjoy a little mom and son time with a good meal.  I decided to order the strictly off the appetizer section on the menu because I notice a few eye catching dishes that caught my last time and I was was happy with both choices and my son ordered mac and cheese with grilled shrimp added.

My appetizer choices consisted of shrimp &  sausage quesadilla and Joe's Rocking Oysters. The oysters were filled a great cornbread stuffing that was filled with corn, andouille sausage, crabmeat and pepper jack cheese, I could barely taste the crab, but the freshness of the oysters was excellent and the overall taste of the dish was delicious just wish I could of tasted a little more crab.  The shrimp & sausage quesadilla was full of flavor and I would definitely order both appetizers again.  My son was like mom this mac and cheese is great next time I want to add crab to it to kick it up another notch (yes we watch food network together lo) but seriously everytime we come to Whiskeys Joe's the service is great, our food is fresh and we are never disappointed.   We had an awesome time."
GK_9NYxnQq5DUOcfjSUTAw,4,"It did seem like we waited a while between ordering our drinks and appetizer and actually ordering the food, but other than that it was great! We had the Red Rum Runner and a Corona to start off with, followed by the Rocking Oysters (our favorite oysters so far), regular raw oysters, and the Eggplant Crab Stack salad. Everything was delicious and besides that one long 'break' our service was great, too! We would recommend. :)"
pVZKiWrwYopDkwrE5CtlLQ,2,asked for medium well not burnt on burger but burger was very burnt. fries were greasy. service was lousy. waiter seemed very scattered & lost. girls at hostess station were uppity and rude.
ZvIy15050CT_le-PRavN6Q,2,"Pretty view but two fish tacos, a bowl of mac and cheese and two cokes are just not good enough to rack up a $45 tab for lunch. This is my second visit and probably last. Food just doesn't deserve the price."
BLSTSjaLA4fhDMUpMARo8w,2,The food was like fast food. We asked for medium well they give use extra well done. The tacos were ok
E2gQ2WGO0MegcpkBjDS-Aw,5,"Great view. Great food. 
Fun place to eat. 
Good local Grouper.
The Price was not the best value. I guess it is expected given the view. 
Shelby is an amazing server. 
I will be back agin when in town."
_8i7Jf8OpupbqoHOexeQNQ,2,"I have been to Whiskey Joe's twice before, the first time I went my experience was good. The food and drinks were good, the outside atmosphere you couldn't beat! However, I went last night HORRIBLE service, we sat at the outside bar for 15min trying to get one of the bartenders attention. There were three bartenders working at the time, none of them bothered to look our way. It was almost as if they didn't want to serve us, they were busy closing up. Even though it wasn't  closing time! It was a Monday night at 9:45pm and we couldn't get any service. We ended up leaving, 100% will not return."
OpKyr0vQhy8ShZskaqm7Hw,5,Awesome bar and great service on the bay! Grab a drink and a seat under an umbrella then enjoy!
3Pf5rkjDOF3sVl0HjE9NYA,5,We love Whiskey Joe's. They have an awesome beach that you can play bags on or have a fire or just hang out by the water. The drinks are amazing. Perfect amount of strong without even tasting the alcohol. They have my favorite wings ever which are the Coconut rum glazed wings. I could eat them everyday.
L194fSnlRSf-WbvMRnJ61w,5,"The food, & service is Awesome!! Great atmosphere next to the beach!! I recommend this place to all!!"
Tt9iiNn_Y6wXfFifBP9CTg,4,"I really enjoyed our evening at Whiskey Joe's. We came here to meet up with an old friend that lives in the Tampa area. Their parking lot is far too small for the amount of people that come here but you can use the beach parking next door for $1 but keep in mind it closes at 9PM (move your car before then!). 

Whiskey Joe's has a beach bar where you can sit by the gulf and drink your worries away. They also have plenty of seating indoors, as well as an outdoor deck area. We grabbed a table inside by the bar since everything else was an 1+ hour wait on a Wednesday night. The drinks are good but not very strong (I had a mojito). The food is actually delicious. My coconut chicken was perfect with the right balance of flavors.

Something funny happened while we were visiting. The power went out and popped right back on. They must have everything backed up (smart) since they never lost our tab. But the music and TVs took a while to reboot. Not sure how often this happens. Still a great place to visit."
Yib2FXM8d1zvOyA1WpNdUg,5,"Totally recommend if you don't know what you're in the mood for, their seafood is great! (I'm very picky with seafood) as well as their meats and pastas. 

Waiting time- at first we were going to sit outside in the sand area but the band was playing and it was too loud for our liking. So we opted in for inside where it was nice and cool. 

Staff- Our waitress was Sara and in training, Brandon. Both lovely people, and really friendly! 
They didn't make us wait long at all or forget about us. We were actually lucky to have two servers, they worked well as a team and did everything quickly and efficiently. Sara was super nice and let me order a smaller portion of the Mac and cheese since I only wanted a small side order with my food. 

Waiting time for food- Apps - we ordered two apps and they took about 10-15 min. The queso and chips were great! Also recommend the guacamole on the side 
     -Entrees- right after we were finished with the apps the main entrees came right away (all at the same time) 
The food was hot! Which is good because that means it wasn't out sitting. I ordered the swashbuckler basket, it's all FRIED. It was very tasty, I couldn't finish it, it was a lot of food. The Mac and cheese is SO GOOD! 
*we didn't order any desserts because we were way too full. 

*overall it was a great experience, friendly staff all around, great food, seating is great, and awesome location!"
lR_Ou5w_I-xP5D5uTlDoOQ,1,"Drinks are average. Staff is one of the worst I have experienced. Waited for an hour for food that the bartender never put in and ended up leaving because it would have taken over 2 hrs for nachos. I would not suggest this place to anyone who has any experience working in the service industry. To say the least in a city that bars like this are common, don't waste your time here."
OeHvpqz_E6aR2O-UFmj0zg,4,"Visiting on a work trip and this has been my favorite spot. Great environment on the patio and the barefoot bar. The chicken Alfredo and pepperoni pizza were in the top ten best I've had. Has been live music each time I've been, even on the weekdays. If you're in the area you have to check it out."
WGzh7g7Pl0h3MsoEQpRsDA,4,"Beautiful view, food is good, have great beer variety even ballast point on draft. The music was ok, good when they played Caribbean/reggae but than they had some country in between...doesn't go good with beach. Very friendly staff."
j8JGNgDLHabPuVYi8Znn5A,3,"Nice environment, friendly staff. Food was just ok and was expensive. I dont think it was the chefs fault. I just think they are trying to pump out too much food so the quality and recipes weren't there. 

I give their ranch a 2 out of 5 stars."
puB4RuVN5msIvmreppe0tA,4,"Just the vibe me and my family were looking! We really enjoyed our visit to this beach front funky restaurant! Valet parking is only $5 bucks and the servers were amazing ! Everything on the menu looked amazing, I was even checking out other customer meals as they were coming out haha. I ordered the swashbuckler basket and was blown away with the fried scallops and the whitefish! I also had two margaritas made to perfection ! Next time me and my family are in Tampa, Whiskey Joe's will be the move !"
nJHts2hyhcLN7v4UPLQhcg,3,Pricey tourist type of trap.  Seafood was fresh.  Meals very pricey.  Beautiful setting on the Bay.
Qby_xKMDK0z7kSeCD7DWyg,3,"Visited here last Sunday while they hosted a Steelers fan get together. I don't watch much football, but had friends in town so I decided to go with them. I had been to whiskey joes in the past and this was actually a better experience than the past. 

This is actually somewhat of a hard review. If I were to strictly rate the venue it was a good experience. The bar tenders and wait staff were fast and friendly. The line to get in moved quickly. I had been here a few years ago and I don't remember them having police officers so I felt this was a good addition. The dj and reggae band were both good.

The crowd is the biggest drawback. Since I went to a Steelers party I actually think the crowd was a good mix of people, but this does not seem to be their typical crowd. It's still a bit interesting in the fact that you will see girls dressed like they are going to a nightclub walking around with their two year old son... I think this is more of the ""regular"" crowd this place attracts. If you are going to people watch maybe a good place, but not exactly my scene."
3j3D4tKGFzz4XuYIShIu2A,2,Whiskey joes use to be good but then it turned into chain restaurant like food. I also got shit on by pigeon and the deck was too windy
aCrrHRsPV4xW2EWYqEGi3Q,3,"Good basic beach bar. Decent food. Cold beer. Can sit on the beach, patio or indoors. Good time place. A step above your chain restaurants."
VwXwYS2RxVIhVppMoRwbSA,1,"I went here about 5 years ago and I remembered it being good so I decided to try it again.  Ugh.  We sat down and not 1 person acknowledged us.  We waited about 15 mins to put in our drink order...we should've just left then.   We ordered 2 appetizers..and we were gonna order more but after waiting 30 mins to get chips with queso we couldn't believe our 2nd appetizer never came out.  The queso was cold, not melted at all so we just asked the waitress to pop it in the microwave for us real quick bc we were starving. We finished the chips and still no wings....she came back about 15 mins apologizing for the wait.  We are currently still here waiting for the wings(20 mins after we finished the chips) I wish we could just get our check and leave.  I don't even want them anymore."
CxFfNtsDdPvm94JbcE4kBQ,5,Cute beach side bar.  Came for Gator Bites.   I got the steamed clams.   They are yummy
m7huf_fUDAKekoTA4XeipQ,5,"Met friends reuniting after 15 years...great service (thanks Neil), great food and a really beautiful sunset. Go...enjoy and reconnect!"
bcitsxutYLtiN0Fz7_0QDA,1,*horrible service*  we ate outdoors and the waitress took foooorrrr evvveeerrr!  The drinks are small for what you pay and the food wasnt that great.  Not recommending this to anyone.
dxzpgOlSiLWdfOiknCO2CQ,5,"Every year we come to Clearwater Beach for vacation. After we land at TPA we take a short ride to Whisky Joe's for our first Florida meal. You'll read that parking here can be a problem, you usually have to use their valet service. However, once you get over that it's all up hill from there. This year we started with the simple chips and queso appetizer. There was a hearty fill of queso and the waitress was nice enough to give us extra chips so we could finish it all. The drinks are a little pricy but they're not terrible. The food and atmosphere is what we love. The staff is always friendly and helpful from the hostess to the waitstaff.  This year I ordered the fried grouper sandwich. When the plate arrived I was stunned to see the large filet of grouper sticking out the side of the bun. I didn't expect that much fish on one sandwich! It was of course tasty and came with well seasoned fries. A great way to start our vacation as usual!"
F5-BLM9paAb45oelVrnDWQ,4,"Went for Happy Hour. Drinks were good, service was good. I ordered the Carnitas which was delicious and plentiful for the price. Sitting out in the deck gives you a beautiful view of the sunset. Afterward we moved out to one of the fire pits on the beach. Overall the restaurant can be described as ""chainy"" so don't expect anything gourmet but for what it is, it's decent. Worth it just for the view of the sunset."
PwA2HYjAxGcvDSHktbI5qQ,5,"It was our first experience after our flight landed. We had heard great reviews on google and yelp so we determined to check it out ourselves. We had dinner right on the beach at the Tiki Bar. As the sunset went down the view was unexplainable. The bar staff Courtney and Caroline where we sat before we took our table were extraordinary in customer service.Their personality along with the Florida sun made us feel like we were on an island getaway. After being seated at one of the eleven Tiki Tables on the beach  we were introduced to Jennifer  and Alex our wait staff. They were pleasant, attentive and comical. As a whole I would rate Whiskey Joes a  in the sand environment with phenomenal customer service. I also might add while we were enjoying our dinner we walked upstairs to catch the sunset from the second deck. The bartender staff on had Julie and Marquise were super friendly as well while we savored the brief moment of the Florida sunset."
wP3Q_8VeY3bYyNSSwT21YA,5,Super fun family lunch! Grouper was really good and the drinks were fabulous! Nothing beats the view or the service! Can't wait to bring my family here when they come into town!
meOqpAf9xM2pLL_7UkXFGw,1,"This is truly one of the worst restaurants in Tampa, you are paying for a view. The food is mostly terrible, with a couple exceptions and is waaaay overpriced. Spend the extra 30 minutes and go to the rep beaches in Clearwater and St. Pete. I went there on my 30th birthday, the plumbing was not working and I discovered the restaurant did not have a microwave...They never really have any specials other than a happy hour (weak drinks) and their live bands were so bad they actually made us laugh."
1QKzCECcOTufirIbNbUopw,5,"I'm giving this restaurant a 5* because of Jamie, our server. 
On March 7 I was taking family to the airport & we stopped in for an early dinner. 
The food was great (4*) but Jamie did all she could to make it better. 
I ordered crab cakes from the appetizer menu. They came with a hot sauce which I didn't want. Jamie recommended a tartar sauce or the remoulade which was perfect. 
My sister had the Squash Buckler Basket (seafood, fries & cole slaw). 
Her husband had the Strawberry Guava Ribs w/fries & slaw. Jamie was a hit with him making suggestions for different beers he wanted to try. 
I also had a basket of fries which was enough for 4 people!!!
We had a window seat & watched the people zipping by on water crafts. It was too windy to sit outdoors. So the ambiance was great. 
Jamie took great care of us, so I hope you get her as a server or someone equally as terrific. 
We really enjoyed this experience & will repeat it soon I hope."
W4qGQBw-AbXys6-oIxuMTw,2,"The things they can't control are their best qualities: beach, weather, people watching. As for their food, drinks and service; horrible. Bland and inconsistent food, drinks are fine, and service is their weakest point. I actually waited 20 minutes to for a drink and eventually gave up after being continually ignored by their servers. I haven't received quick service to date and have finally gave up on this place. Worst. Service . Ever."
4syXx0soYwtgZ7lu5OkS8w,3,This place has a nice outdoor area. There are opportunities for improvements in food. The crab cakes I ordered where less than 3 oz. for an order and mostly breading. The price for them was over what it should be. On forth of July they had an old classic rock band.. which was okay but then they had some blinding light show that was horrendous. I don't think it's even legal as it literally was like lasers reaching across to the adjacent buildings. Hopefully given this place's location some improvements can be made.
_kVzQWr8Ke50mc74_hQhCg,2,I was not happy at all. I'm a foodie so I'll give anything a try. I should have know to turn away based off the other reviews. I'm in town for the weekend and my hotel is next door. I went to whisky joes and was served soggy fried fish. Not only was my fish was soggy but so was my friends. We order the Jamaican White fish. The batter wasn't cooked all the way.  Our server was polite. I can't fault him for the cooks action but for that they are getting 2 stars.
0cGJKTTbHs9C97gUeG_sJA,5,Live band music is very good today! Lots of people celebrating Labor Day weekend!  Party on!
JMCtBR4Th3cSe_JKa6QJcg,2,"I've been to this place several times and always enjoyed it. So this Sunday I had friends in town and suggested we spend the day here. Although coming on a Sunday was a massive mistake. The beach part we were all so excited about was covered with armed security guards which made all of us uncomfortable. As a few more minutes passed the air was full with marijuana smoke. We also saw more underwear than we felt comfortable seeing trying to eat. I am leaving this review for anyone that does not enjoy loud rap music, weed smoke, and underwear to AVOID THIS PLACE ON A SUNDAY!"
RlTAaNV7VQSvb9_bXtfGEA,5,My husband and I joined some friends here and really enjoyed ourselves. The drinks were really good and I loved the atmosphere. I would like to come during the day to see the beach in daylight as well. The food was great and big portions. My husband had Alfredo and I had pizza. My only complaint the night we went is there was some big concert event so we had to do valet parking and we didn't have cash so there was a bit of a hassle trying to get cash from a friend and then paying them back later. However overall a good experience and we will definitely be back.
HDZ7PSGzQzeuyNZCGdW-RA,5,"This is my #1 spot. I am able to sit close to the water and have some awesome drinks without having to drive an hour to st.pete waterfront.

food is good drinks are great. staff can be a bit nicer, but it is always busy so they do what they can.

Check this place out whenever you want to kick back toes in the sand."
4zPJ9b3vBsv6z5tuXIxh6g,3,"The food's nothing special but the setting is nice.  It's really nice to sit outside on the beach where the bartenders are the best servers in the establishment.  We had typical beach bar drinks, my mojito was fine, grouper sandwich was okay, made for a nice few hours hanging around without any work to do.  It's much better to arrive just as they open, the crowd doesn't come until just after noon and long before then we had the best seats at the bar.  This has to be the most child friendly bar (the outside, ""barefoot bar"" part) in town.  I feel sorry for the wait-staff hopping the tables in the sand, a workout with platters of food and drink with small fast moving obstacles (i.e. children) in the sun, and yet I couldn't help notice some cheap tipping going on around me.  I don't know why anyone would choose indoors on a nice day."
eIhwkA_Xw4QneEZw4xo_3Q,1,"One star is really pushing it. And I mean really pushing it. So came during dinner rush on a Saturday 2/25/2017 and fully expecting it to be busy since my girlfriend and I both are in the service industry. 45 minute wait for a table no big deal. 

Here's where the terrible, just horrific service began. 

Seated at 7:06, wasn't greeted by either bartender on the patio for ten minutes. Keep in mind the dinner rush was dying. Finally after being greeted we ordered food, nachos and ribs. Both foods if you aren't aware, are already are precooked and half to be heated in the oven, nacho toppings are scoop and serve. 

Our ""server"" didn't come back to check on us once. So 40 minutes later our food finally comes out, cold. It's been dead in the window for a minimum of 15 minutes, guacamole and sour cream are both warm, the fries and ribs were cold and the barbecue sauce had turned into a glaze. During the period where the food came out, we had already talked to the manager who was more than understanding. Comped the meal and told my girlfriend he would get new food out. Our server was made aware by the manager to comp the meal. And the kicker is, we waited ANOTHER 30 MINUTES WHEN IT WAS DEAD ONLY TO BE TOLD THERE WAS ""a miscommunication and that the food would be out shortly. "" 

So in ending, terrible absolutely miserable service in a post dinner rush establishment is absolutely unacceptable, just terrible all around. Servers and bartenders need better training and ""communication"" and checking on tables/greeting tables should be brought up in your staff meetings. Food for thought."
ruOW79BI_AZPLZ97SdUgeA,4,Amazing location! On the beach bar and Tikki huts with fire pits.
9PDiqgW_s8DK-azBW4dkFA,1,"This place needs a serious management overhaul as well as serving staff.  How it has even managed with three stars is beyond me. Have waited almost 15 minutes without seeing a single server to approach the table. Have only been to this place once and that was for an event, came a second time for the sunset and the nachos which I felt were pretty good the first time. I would love to review that but I haven't had the opportunity to order yet, nachos...!!! That's all I have come here for and it's taking almost 20 minutes to be seen. Quite honestly I wouldn't recommend this place unless you go to the bar and order which was actually pretty prompt.  The service however...I've gotten better service at a red robin."
FEgO_JWieOKD2-ycBHaXWQ,5,What a great location. Original mojitos on the beach. Great service ... especially from our rocking waitress Noah. Gator bites were tasty. Jerk wings were outstanding! A definite must-visit in Tampa.
y0uZHe__VCeob156I4387A,3,This is my first-stop Go-To place when friends or family come in from out of town and are hungry and thirsty right off the plane. It's a hop and skip from TPA. Sitting on the deck or at a bar-top table with a couple of boat drinks and a good burger while watching the sun dip over the Bay sets the tone for their whole visit. If it is the middle of the day the wait staff will leave you alone to catch up and plan. The beer selection is limited and basic ... which by local standards means a couple of local drafts along with a solid drink menu. Stick to the bar food basics and you cannot go wrong.
hTAWgVinmpZUsygF5OX3yg,1,"BIG WARNINGS ABOUT THIS PLACE!!!!!!

I actually don't know how this place passes their inspections by the health department.  Walking up to the entrance it had a strong odor of horse crap.  It only got worse as I went in and had a drink at the bar while waiting for my group.  The place smelled like an out house.  I was at the inside bar and felt like I was at an outside picknic with all the flies that were inside.

Bar service- the girl with the piercings and tattoo's was very good and kept control of the orders coming in.  I do have a issue with the two other employees hanging out behind the bar eating their dinners.  Can't they go somewhere else?  I wouldn't dare ask them for something to disturb their meals.

When they were done, they didn't even take their plates and containers away.  The bartender was prepping mint leaves and pouring beer right over the fly filled leftover plates.  

I saw servers walking around playing with their long hair.  The girls eating behind the bar didn't wash their hands before going back on the floor.  One turned the faucet on and let her hands touch the water, but no soap.  Another male server picked up someone's blended drink from the bar.  He put in on his tray and they licked his fingers and said yum.  Then proceeded to put lime wedges in other drinks.

I found it strange that the bar prepped about 30 mojitos before anyone even ordered them.  Yes, the put the lime, mint and some type of syrup into all the classes and then stuck them under the bar until someone would order one.  Keep in mind- there are flies EVERYWHERE.

On to dinner- we had a large private party.  We have come month after month for about 6 or 7 months and have had the exact same food in the buffet.  None of it has been all that great in the past, but edible.  Well this visit was much different!  They brought out a tray of about 30 chicken breasts (jamaican jerk) and every single piece was completely raw!  The waitress was walking around telling everyone not to eat the chicken.  It was slightly dark so some people had some of the chicken because they couldn't see it.  The plantains tasted like they were cooked last week.

The manager tried to accomodate and change out the items for fries and beans.  However, that diidn't change the fact that this place is nasty.  If their kitchen runs anything like the rest of the place does, this place should be closed."
Fp9Ck0_3zT-0x7u-LWodfg,3,"Hubs always wants seafood, and since this restaurant in Rocky Point isn't far from our house, we decided to try it for dinner on a Friday night in late October. I signed up for their loyalty club & was delighted to immediately receive an e-coupon for a free appetizer. We also browsed their menu online before leaving home, so we knew what we wanted. Given their location, I expected so much more from Whiskey Joe's. Unfortunately, I was disappointed.

We used Open Table within the Yelp app to reserve a table. This was my first time using that feature, and it was easy-peasy. Although, when I tried to make an account afterward via my Google creds, an error stated I'd already made a reservation with the same Gmail. Uhm, that's correct, so what's the problem? Anyway, I digress... We were immediately seated after choosing where to sit: inside or on the patio. But neither the deck nor inside were busy at 8:30 on a Friday night, so the reservation was moot. 

I'll specifically mention that our hostess was incredibly accommodating. When hubs didn't like the patio table she led us to first, she quickly brought us to a table inside near the bar. And she told us we were free to move to a empty window table once those nearby had been bussed. She even came back a few minutes later to let us know she'd found a bus boy to clean off any table we wanted. (No explanation why so many empty tables hadn't been cleared). Ultimately, we decided to stay at the table close to the bar so we could watch Game 3 of the World Series & Navy vs USF. 

We found drinks to be a bit pricey. At $9 & $10 for nearly every mixed drink, we opted to get a Bud Light pitcher for $10.70. It was actually a fairly large pitcher, with at least 4 full drinks! However, we were given thick plastic glasses, which seemed cheap. Hubs asked the bartender that brought the pitcher if he had any chilled glasses, and the guy rudely replied he'd just taken these plastic cups out of the cooler. A facetious comment, indeed, as they were warmer than room temp. 

Our appetizer, loaded fries, was served cold (yes, colder than those glasses). My first clue should've been the intact shredded cheese on top. The flavor of the pork was actually pretty good, but the whole thing was fridge-cold. When our server finally checked on us & we told her, she apologized profusely & took it away with the promise of a hot order ASAP. And the replacement was fantastic! The BBQ sauce was sweet but not overly so, and nicely accented the sweet potato waffle fries. And the shredded pork was amazing. Interestingly, this second order didn't have any green onions; see my photos. Not an issue at all, but noted. 

We ordered the Swashbuckler Basket to share, and thank goodness we did - it was HUGE! And delicious! Two giant pieces of white fish, a good-size skewer of scallops, and three of the largest shrimp I've ever seen, all fried & served on top of a big basket of fries. So much yummy food for $16.99! This was a steal for the quantity & quality of seafood we enjoyed. 

Our server was ok. She was friendly when she came to our table, but she didn't check on us often. She seemed more interested in a nearby table of 8 that was seated shortly after we were. Once we'd paid, while we were still finishing our pitcher, I saw her cash out & sit with another server across the bar, so we may have been her last table (apparently that table of 8 didn't order food). Her end-of-shift attitude was obvious. I understand, but don't like it. 

The ladies bathroom was terrible. Lots of stalls, but the only empty stall had something disgusting in the bowl that staff hadn't cleaned up. Then the first stall that opened was completely out of toilet paper, so I waited longer. The third stall was the charm. But I noticed their auto-flush toilets don't really work, which may explain the situation in the first stall. Regardless, the bathroom had clearly not been stocked or cleaned in a while. 

After dinner, we walked down to the beach bar. What a disaster going on out there! The bar itself is fairly large, also serving people walking up from the fire pits & tables in the sand, with only 2 bartenders on a Friday night. This is where the action was at Whiskey Joe's, but the wait at the bar was atrocious, both to get our drinks & to cash out. We gave up after the first round. 

The parking situation is ridiculous... Valet parking is nearly mandated, as only half an aisle is self-parking in the restaurant's lot. Paid public parking nearby has signs posted everywhere that the lot is closed & locked at 9pm. But when we left at 10:30, that lot was still accessible. Valet parking was only $5, but being forced to use it left me feeling manipulated - a bad start to the evening. 

The food is the only reason I'm giving Whiskey Joe's a 3rd star. Service was barely 2 stars, and the bathroom situation almost makes me deduct a star. Given the great food & proximity to home, we'll surely return, with lower expectations."
p2MMS7qlTJeJ0ugqH_erVQ,5,"We landed, checked in and headed over. Food was good(shrimp tacos). We sat on the beach side and our server, Grey, was excellent!!! Had a great time. Felt like we were at the ocean even thou it's on the bay!"
g1DNgvhiiYhfuFM4DitPbg,4,"Morgan was our waitress on a very special Birthday night with a demanding group!! Very impressed with her and we will be back!  Thanks, Morgan you ROCK!"
Cxt1GhcGmcR5WEcqhu0QMw,5,"The seafood mac n' cheese was one of the best things I've ever eaten. The chef has a blend of a few different cheeses in there that's absolutely spectacular, and the shrimp complements it really well. I also had the mussels appetizer - the sauce was super tasty. The place itself is pretty nice, they've got a great view with an awesome beach bar and a gift shop. All in all a great experience."
8shU67TbO0IiMfyf8Ery7g,3,"Located conveniently close to Tampa off the causeway and across from Hogan's Beach, Whiskey Joe's offers a more spacious and more relaxed beach than Hogan's to enjoy tropical frozen drinks, live acoustic band, corn hole, a camp fire at night, and some seafood. You can pull up your boat or jetskies on the east side of whiskey Joe's by the barefoot beach area. On the west side of Whiskey Joe's there is an air conditioned indoor bar, outdoor deck, and 1 volleyball court. I prefer this place over Hogan's because it's more relaxed and more spacious. Naturally, this place loses a star because the beach is not as nice as St Pete or Clearwater because it is in the Bay with stagnant water and sludgy ocean floor sand but it is conveniently close to Tampa and a popular boaters hangout if you don't feel like trekking all the way out to another beach. They have a large variety or frozen drinks: traditional mojito, mango mojito, strawberry orange cooler, whiskey Joe's lemonade, true blue, razz lemonade, arctic chill, spiced colada, Bacardi punch, and margaritas. They also have a $3 domestic Brewskies special until 7 most days, otherwise it's $3.50 which is pretty reasonable compared to Hogan's or Bahama Breeze next door. Their margaritas aren't the best but those frozen drinks are pretty good. I had their Mahi Mahi tacos and fire cracker shrimp and they were pretty good. Service at the outside bar can take awhile if it's busy because it's a big bar and they usually only have 2 or 3 server but that's expected. When Hogan's does EDM concerts I usually watch them from here next to the fire.  You can catch a nice sunset from the west side of whiskey Joe's opposite the barefoot beach area. Will be coming back again! Thanks!

Cons: The outside bathrooms are nasty port-o-potties but they got regular bathrooms if you walk inside. Their drink prices are higher than average at $6.50 for well mixed drinks and $9 for frozen tropical drinks.  There is limited valet parking onsite only and a pay lot for Ben T Davis Beach operated by credit card until 6pm, but if you come after 6pm, you can park for free!"
EN_3UzaQa45__qb8hSmh6w,1,"If this restaurant had a face, I would punch it. I knew when I walked in, the food would suck. It just had that "" hey, we don't give a shit  about the food kinda vibe"". Oh well, been to places like that before so..... think.... what can I order they cant screw up AND wont make me sick. Ta Da Tacos, cooked meat, a flour tortilla, hot sauce, yep this might actually work.  OMG and yes I just shouted OMG. First bite I got the distinct taste of mold. Yep, mold like when you eat a piece of bread that is a day too old, and has those little blue/green specs on the crust. I examined the tortilla carefully, It cant be moldy. It actually looked fine so I took a small bite of the steak. YEP, inspector Columbo I am. Found the offender but how? How the hell do you get mold taste onto beef?  The meat was soaked in a marinade, Mojito is what I think the menu said. It had to be in there somewhere, I don't know exactly but I know what it tasted like and that was mold. The good news is the server responded immediately with the offer of a replacement meal. I ordered the wings and they were just like any wings at any crappy restaurant. Which after having my food taste of mold... was a welcome change."
FN-kz0NoPTbJDeR7IjMreQ,3,"Passed by this restaurant all the time while visiting the Clearwater Beach and decided to finally stop by. Nicer better outside looking than Hogan's, server was very friendly and food outstanding. The only reason I knocked down 1 Star is because they sold me the $20 coconut and refills where $8 dollars and bill doesn't disclose that. They claim they can do whatever drink they don't specify will be well then they charge you the premium liquor separate. It's too confusing, otherwise it was a pleasant experience."
U2RiuPaWU93kRZC3-RZ-HA,2,"Outside service is terrible. You have to flag a server down and they seem to do their best to avoid new tables. 

Food and drinks are decent for the price and it's a pretty fun atmosphere on the weekends 

Come for the fun, not the service"
zkA_TxRmXJcXDzGr7YTR_A,2,"Are you kidding me ,  on the water awesome view.... But warm beer in old plastic cups.  My boyfriend's cup actually exploded.... No offer of replacing.  No wait staff or food offered that I could see.  Great potential if you can get it together"
RzIfLA1IoS947t960_6g1A,1,"Unfortunately the anticipation for the sunset was spoiled by horrible parking.  It continued with ridiculous service. If you are sat and greeted late then the water,appetizers should be brought fast. In addition the entrees were cold. Busy restaurant with subpar management equals a subpar experience.  Food wasn't even finished means taste buds were not jumping....stay away from this place if you can. There's no other spots really to watch sunsets so just watch and dip!"
8CiwOytLHonwvojxOi9dfQ,3,"Casual Bar, Good Atmosphere and Great for families as well. We sent back the nachos but the Shrimp and Sausage quesadilla were Bomb.."
MZ6y74HS7zWEPLGnMomz_g,1,"Slow, unorganized( heard that out of the bartenders lips while sitting there) subpar food..bartenders ask you if you need anything, then look puzzled because you ask for a menu. Also and I hate to say this but..very rude and unattractive people that work here with major attitudes. I'm sorry that I don't relate to your backwoods, redneck ass(bud light)..but yeah I would like to see what bottles you have on your drink menu.
I will say it's a damn shame because you have a great location with hell of a view..could be a great vibe but it's not. Invest in your people. I'll be at Aqua across the street."
h0Qczw53n_eFnYOoo5-8iQ,4,"Went here for lunch and was fortunate to miss any crowds. The parking lot was full so thanks for the complimentary valet. The restaurant looked fairly clean and was pretty spacious. We sat outside and enjoyed the beautiful view. 

Service was quick and friendly. Our waitress knew the menu pretty well and served our drinks pretty quickly. Beer was tasty and the sweet tea was good. The food was good as well (I had blackened grouper sandwich), but definitely not anything to rave about. The fries could have been better and I rarely ever feel that way. 

Overall I had a good time. It definitely was a welcoming place with good food and a great location. I would definitely recommend this place for food and drinks and fun, and definitely plan on returning."
k4AgmC-tt2xMTw38AoXkXA,2,"Went here with my family for dinner and drinks, and I was not impressed at all. The best part of this place was seeing the wildlife in the water over the patio, which sits out over the water, and the waitress was good. As soon as we we're seated at 9:30 on a Thursday night, the waitress informed us that we had 2 minutes to order before the kitchen closed. After rushing to order at a place I never been before, I ordered an entree with grilled fish, scallops and shrimp all over cooked and chewy. Ultimately I paid 200 bucks for 4 adults and 2 children and the only thing that tasted worth a Damn was the gator bites. I wouldn't return to this place if they had free drinks and free food......PS I still tipped the waitress 45 bucks even tho she gave me 95 dollars in 5s as my change, cause it ain't her fault the owner shouldn't be allowed to own a cat,let alone a restaurant and bar on the water."
UALInfQi4XFT0M6rCsAckA,2,Location is amazing off the beach. Great view from the table looking out to the water. If it wasn't due to the location I don't think this place would still be in business anywhere else. Went with a big crowd of 12 ppl. There was a long wait for the table. I was so disappointed to wait so long for bland food. Had 3 shrimp tacos which tasted like frozen shrimp from the grocery store. I only ate one. Didn't like anything anyone else ordered.  I won't be back.
Dy_FtsmbexgjK0_KT3sDcA,1,Great views and drinks but the food is terrible. I had the crab/artichoke dip and it tasted smokey. The chips were sprinkled with something that made them taste like Doritos. The shrimp pasta had 5 shrimp and no flavor.
w2cpN_AtTt42cxavqmrmvQ,3,"I visited on Tuesday, March 22, 2016 and was lucky enough to sit outside on their gorgeous deck.  View was fabulous; was there for happy hour so was able to watch the sun hover over the Tampa Bay.  The atmosphere alone could give this restaurant a 5 star rating...if only it were that easy..

I ordered the Jumbo Gulf Shrimp and my fiancé got the Gator Bites.  For $19.99, I felt like the shrimp was underwhelming at best.  The meal came out in a basket, with 6 shrimp sitting on top of a bed of fries, with a side of cocktail sauce.  If they consider the shrimp I received as jumbo, then I would hate to see what they consider small.  Each shrimp was no bigger than my thumb and deep fried.  The fries were tasty, especially with the vinegar they had sitting at the table.  But for the price point, I was overall disappointed with the meal.

The Gator Bites came with fried pickles in the basket for an overall enjoyable appetizer.   My bill for the 2 meals and 4 beers was just over $50 (beer was priced at $3 for happy hour).  

I would definitely come back, but most likely just stick to sitting at the outside bar to enjoy the beach and cocktails."
lCjD6QTpYsmWjTIqrlPhiw,4,"So we came here hoping to get brunch but it's their regular menu. This is a super  chill place to hang out. The traditional beach bar vibe. Nice big windows that overlook Tampa bay, lots of outdoor seating. They have a nice house made Bloody Mary. Next door is a beach with dj and reggae. 5 buck cover seemed reasonable for the view. It was getting ready to pour so we passed."
V_tMwd82Gjo5M4mPn6e9qQ,5,Please come in and try this place. So awesome and so welcoming. We had the pleasure of having Maggie which had an awesome personality and was completely on top of everything. Thanks for making her part of the team so my experience could be perfect. We will definitely be back
rz-ykVnTJgZx3QmWV01vXg,3,Very cool place to hang out. Has a great water front bar and seating. The food was ok. Had the steak tacos which were decent. Its a nice place to wind down after the beach.
vyVsKhim8hjrPpmmBlqQpg,4,Whiskey Joe's Tampa has a cute little set up on the causeway.  If you are looking for a quick stop and want t feel as if your are at the each this is your spot.  The food is hit or miss and the drinks can afford a little more alcohol to be put in them.  The fun theme party's are always awesome no matter the type of music.
aspE3ixySDPFqM5KJFrQFQ,4,"I would love to give this place 5 stars on the View alone. The food is good plenty of choices especially if you have a group. The night we went it was rainy so we weren't able to be outside for the sunset. That was a bummer but I guess I can't blame the restaurant for the weather. 

Our server was as sweet as she could be and she was trying her best. I will give her high marks for effort. She did however mention it was only her 2ND day so I'd say she was pretty awesome. I am surprised at management for leaving her to fend for herself so quickly."
RLoBhBS0idaRi0Nx3gzN0w,5,Island coconut oyster and firecracker shrimp is a must have to order when you come here! This place is very friendly and food and drinks are very good here. Plus its on the water so you have an excellent view while enjoying your experience!
W1QTdCNUcagu3bL2upjLzw,2,"The view is remarkable, the food isn't. Glorified bar food basically. They offer some gator which is cute for the tourists. By boat or foot this place is best for getting shitfaced, then going to a real restaurant for some real gator..like Charley's. I'm sure to get dragged back here at some point. It's unavoidable."
hQe-75LFrOLvlyDhaEk7Bg,5,"Going straight to the point - eat at the outside bar. Food ordered is cooked at the food truck! The best! 
My favorite is the Chicken Wings and also the FRIES! (Yep capitalized for a reason, they are that good).
Get the wings without any sauce.
The cocktails are not that great but good enough.
Bring some friends; great atmosphere."
_68xGRXdzJgeczo3y_f0eA,5,"One of my favorite places at Tampa, close to the beach,
Have fun at the beach sand bar, the menu is really good include different king of food, burguers, tacos,
Salads, choices for appetizers... for couple, family and friends.."
TB_ZQMP9IY59FZgNEKphHA,2,"I wouldn't say this place is bad.... Just nothing special. My fiancé got a burger which was good, and I got the coconut shrimp which were boring. We both got frozen drinks which tasted like a mix without any alcohol ( for which we paid almost ten dollars each). 
The service was good and sitting outside on the deck was very nice. Overall the place seemed like a tourist trap and the limited (and boring) menu made it obvious that management was not interested in having people return."
EFaTGFILkagqawvjidxA0A,1,"Came here on a Saturday to enjoy a meal on the sand with out of town friends. When approaching the  beach area at 6:50pm was told that we needed to pay a cover of $10 each because a band was going to play. when I asked what time do they start was told 9pm. Drove all this way to eat at a table on the sand, parking was a joke as the send you to drive to a public lot where it took 15 min to find a spot open. Then forced to pay an entry fee to eat.  Food was ok, drinks expensive and after the hefty entry fee decided to at least see the band start. They were a Katy Perry/No Doubt cover band that was pretty much a karaoke band. They lost the power to their recorded music portion for a bit and had to stop. Comical to watch a guy fake play the keyboards as his fingers didnt even touch the keys.... and you charged us for this?  Ridicules ..at least the wait staff was nice."
N2vZL47_-aCTs6lMo_nIhA,4,"If you opt to sit inside get a table by the window and enjoy beautiful, relaxing ocean views! We were a party of four. One had a hamburger with fries. It was a huge burger patty and he enjoyed it. My husband and I had a shrimp and crab Louie salad which was plentiful and tasty as well. The only off thing is that I felt they could have been a bit more generous with the crab. Not enough there. Otherwise, a very good and size-able salad with just enough large, tasty shrimp to satisfy. Another had the grilled fish special which I tasted. It was a moist, large piece of fish (my friend couldn't eat it all), and flavored to near perfection.

In many restaurants you can find souvenir T-shirts. Usually you will find loud, crazy, colorful ones with the logo or name of the restaurant in addition to more reserved, tasteful, less tacky ones. I prefer the latter, but when I looked for one of those to purchase, I found none. So, not wanting a loud, cartoon'ish, in your face, type of souvenir to wear I didn't get one there. Hopefully, they will have a better selection when I return. And, I will return for their food and beautiful location!"
xQ8F4J7orihLvuDgSzNXUg,4,"Location A+ you can see amazing sunsets from this place and if you are lucky enough also dolphins playing around the bay. We got the shrimp appetizer and two burgers. Shrimp were really tasty :) burgers were okay. Cocktails are way too sweet tho.
Do yourself a favor and stick with week days.
Weekends are a nightmare! Drunk people screaming and throwing up all over the place/parking lot."
Qks0oTkt9glBMUkIKb-gJw,5,Great service our waitress Aleah was awesome! Very attentive nice view and food was good shrimp tacos
xBlqrmbxzKfNhgyUL2NBYg,5,"A few days ago, I took my fiance to Whiskey Joe's.  The food was better than I expected.  But, truly this is a review of our server, Miss Jenny Cobin.  I have been in the restaurant business all my adult life...over 30 years.  Miss Cobin was one server to remember.  She never approached the table without a smile.  She was at the table within a few minutes of our sitting down.  She brought our drink order within two minutes.  She knew her menu and was able to answer all of our questions.  

I am a smoker, so we started outside.  I asked for an ashtray and she immediately began scouring the landscape for one.  There weren't any outside, none in the server station, so she went all the back to the dishwasher to find the elusive thing.  It seemed a storm was coming across the bay, and Jenny said, ""Don't worry, if the storm comes here, I'll have a table ready for you inside.""  

Again, the food was good.  We love the calamari at Whiskey Joe's.  The mussels were great.  The Mahi Tacos could probably use a little more sauce; but, they were also very good.

The hardest thing for most servers to understand is the time it takes to get a check and get change.  Most servers blow it at this point.  Not Miss Cobin.  We asked for the check, got it moments later, and a minute or two later, she picked it up...perfect.  She parted with an invitation to return.  When I asked for a comment card, it seems Whiskey Joe's does not use them.  However, she said they read Yelp religiously.  So, I am here to give management my feedback, as well as the world.  

Thanks Miss Cobin for a great evening!
Sincerely,
John"
Ll6ShQ0JQh_WwBlc6R_gaA,3,"Very touristy and chain-like... although i don't know if its a chain... but the food isn't bad.

The food is decent but easily forgettable. It's island sounding burgers, seafood bar appetizers, and other seafood. Red Lobster married Applebees. Nothing very WOW. Good place to grab drinks and bring some friends. My burger was cooked well, good size, nothing overpowering. Same with the fries.

The servers are very helpful and the decorations try to keep an island getaway vibe. It threw me off that there's a gift shop up front but the view of the bay outside the windows are amazing. A part of the restaurant actually sits on stilts above the water. Other than that, the place is forgettable... so i'd rather just park my car along the causeway and watch the bay."
8YdSX09UX5uTO97Rg7F_8g,2,"I've been to this restaurant a number of times and each and every time I've been there, the service has been TERRIBLE. Takes forever for the wait staff to come by the table, takes forever for them to take your order, takes forever for your drinks to come, takes forever for them to clear away dirty dishes, takes forever to get your check, and takes forever to receive your change. And I'm pretty sure I've had a different server each time There are, however, two pluses to this restaurant... Food is well prepared and somewhat more creative than you find at the typical seafood chains; and the view is absolutely amazing. Now if only they'd do something about their wait staff."
PAOVfSr6pK1zC_VFnsN_NA,2,Meh. Overpriced decent food. The only thing I will eat here are the nachos (woof). Avoid Sunday's at all cost.
SI2da1lJN4INscYVfGX2aQ,4,"The food was very good. We cone here fairly often. We sat outside beach side and they had a band playing. The only complaint I have is, I would like them to tend to their outside bathrooms more to keep them cleaner and have the hand sanitizer filled for their customers. This is important considering they are eating food. The servers could also be more attentive, especially when it is not very busy."
P7VWX2YQAxyR7vFQxgL6bg,4,"We had a great time last night at Whiskey Joe's. We were seated right away, and we loved the beach themed decor. The views this place has are gorgeous, not a bad seat in the house. Our drink orders were fun, as my wife ordered a virgin piña colada (6 months pregnant) and I ordered the ultimate coronarita. The food was great on my end as I ordered the black and blue cheeseburger! Cajon seasoned beef with creamy blue cheese, so good! My wife had a bowl of clam chowder, which was pretty good, but was missing something. All in all we had great time, and the music/culture of the restaurant is relaxing... Which of course is what vacationing is all about. Way to go Whiskey Joe!"
x56tM0voRHTFWVdg45LmqQ,3,I have been here numerous times now and have debated on how to write this review. It seems that if you eat inside or sit at the beach bar service is average and the same can be said about the food. If you are sitting at a table at the beach service will be slow sometimes very slow. With that being said if you are on vacation it can still be a cool place to go if it is your last day in town as it is close to the airport.
EfP-a6IAfwrhsDe4iAtAMA,5,"Maggie and Nicole were very nice and made the night better with their out going personality!!!!!
Great food!! Atmosphere was perfect. We sat on the deck and our table was right on the edge so we overlooked the water. We watched some fish swim while we drank and waited for our food. I accidentally knocked over my drink from the bar and they quickly cleaned it up and brought me another one. Will definitely go back. Loved it!!!!"
M7BpKkQQp-B0CWW3TOFs9Q,5,"Great spot! I took a client there for dinner and drinks on wednesday night. It was a lot of fun. Cool beach area where you can chill with a large, covered outdoor island bar with tvs on the beach of the bay.  Sat inside for dinner then moved outside, Ash behind the tiki bar was very friendly and entertaining. She was even a big help when there may have been some obvious ""lulls in conversation""...made an otherwise dull business meeting a little more bearable.  I had the huge grilled fish tacos. Plenty of food and good flavor. Check it out."
9e0tkY-3-IV1CHgVK3zJrA,5,"Ashley is exquisite in her ability to provide the finest service. Always courteous, friendly, smiling, prompt and intuitive. You will enjoy the finest time."
E62SsyZyZ05VdiH4pOzNaA,1,"OVER PRICED HORRIBLE FOOD! 

I went here because I always drove by and saw it packed. It's got a great view of the bay and the menu looked good. Man was I fooled! It took like 10 minutes after I was sat for someone to realize I was there. I ordered Mac and cheese & a jerk chicken sandwich with fries. Everything had no taste. The fries had the most flavor of everything. The mac and cheese would of been $12 and the chicken sandwich and fries would of been $12. The only good thing was I told the manager and they took the food and took it off the bill so I can say the service was good once they actually came to the table but the food wasn't worth the money. I got a look at the drink menu and the prices are double what I would pay at like applebees."
TpxUfeRWifRX_przOC0KdA,4,The food and drinks were so good! Nachos for an appetizer were huge and the gator bites were yummy!!  thats all we needed to order to eat. Margarita's were on point!  Sadly had it spilt down my leg by the waiter and then when he went to pick up the plates he knocked me straight in the face. Let's just say the food and drinks were great but my waiter was so clumsy. All in all I would still come back
ly9C34bNlheoLfhcikKPxQ,1,"If you're looking for dangerous fun on the water with a bunch of irresponsible jet-ski owners, then this is the spot for you. Apparently some lady was hit by a jet ski just the day before, knocking her baby from her arms. While I understand this place is probably not a great family atmosphere, I also know that there is a certain population of people, *ahem* Hispanics that bring their skis up there just to show how awesomely cool they are, 20 feet from shore going 40+. If you think I'm being overly critical of one race then go find out for yourself. My girlfriend and I have waverunners ourselves but it makes us look bad with all of these people out there acting like morons. Probably a great place to come wait for a devastating watercraft accident to happen. Sad to say but this is the truth of Whiskey Joes on the weekend."
jz5iO7KERkICewFDHbsXmA,5,"I have only been here once despite living close by and visiting Clearwater beach often. This place is right off the highway to Clearwater and has the most amazing views!! We sat at the bar as the whole place was very busy , including the patio. The beach area has a fee to enter and is a great place to hang out with friends. Would definitely visit again."
fwsa9FitPHZRoZBmIiAstQ,3,"Nice place. Standard bar with all the normal booze and beer. The kicker here was location. Right on the bay, it was gorgeous. They also have a beach bar, pretty awesome."
rPoDz-xORdRPN5Ohu1t5Ag,5,"The food and service was excellent last night. We had nachos, garlic bread and pizza. The drinks were really good as well. We sat outside and the view was amazing. We got there just in time for the sunset. We will be back for sure."
gk5DiJhNGaWI-W61KZhKew,4,"This review is solely about the Barefoot Bar. 

We were there on a Monday afternoon, and had the perfect seats at the bar. The girls were great, ESPECIALLY Brooke! She is one heck of a bartender. Being one myself, that is a pretty bold statement.

The Caesar salad was yummy! The seasoning was really good, and unusual for a salad. We were both thoroughly impressed. The sand was pristine, and you can even pull your boat up to the sand and just relax. 

Hopefully, we can come out on a night where it's really hopping.

Overall an incredibly relaxing place. 

Ps- ask Brooke to make you a Barrel Roll. :)"
RQgnlSxbS3h6fy8YRBLsFw,2,"So and so place. Peanuts are always stale, fish tacos are mediocre. On the other hand staff is always nice and friendly"
5YtpJFH0s1w8yW_BAvJKbg,5,Sunday Funday done right. Right off the causeway awaits an oasis party zone. Great spot to grab a drink and mingle with others as you watch jet skies zip around the bay.  Tiki bar has a wide selection of beer and the standard beach concoctions.  We didn't eat in the restaurant but seemed like a nice set up with a great view of the bay.
hIX-T8m5LN5UzG9wEUMGDg,5,"I love Whiskey Joe's! Any seat in the house has a great view of the sunset over the bay.If you prefer the fresh air, you can get food and drinks outside on the deck or go downstairs on the beach! I also love to come in the summer to watch the rain roll in over the water. This is one of the only places to go to escape the storm and still feel like you are on the beach. 
They have a great drink menu. For a few bucks more, you can get any drink in one of a few different really neat souvenir cups. 
The menu isn't huge but they hit a few be-achy favorites like fish tacos or chicken wings. I usually look at the menu for a few minutes but always go back to my favorite, the nachos!
The only draw back is there is not enough parking at all, but they do have valet."
ukrA00gFBtggtQILAz4R1w,5,We have been here a few times now and now if we are near Tampa we eat here.   Thanx to Jake for making momma smile before she left back to Michigan.
m3dwHyYrraiXeH5lrJEw5A,3,"The location is awesome and magical, waitresses are nice and sweet, the food was OK but their drinks suck! I ordered a tropical Hama mama or something like that..its awful and had a fly in it.

I would come back for the location and the food but not drinks."
aCjGLQSzyvukjvT_2E7tlw,5,Whiskey joes is right on the water and most the hotels shuttle to here as well. They have live music!!!!!
PXF68cn66DkefBrGfAneHg,5,"View: breathtaking (on the water outside seating, on the man made beach, inside all glass enclosure to ensure you have the view, you win in any spot you prefer to sit)
Service: very good
Food: had mojito tacos. Amazing!
Price: reasonable ($11 for the tacos)

Really liked it"
X4yCU1Y58xFU7xuM0Sfjng,3,To be honest I just really like the location and views.  The veggie garden pizza and the shrimp tacos are my go to every time I visit.  I also like their calamari it's always soft. The creamy Alfredo pasta is kinda bland and the chicken on top was super dry (but my mom thought it was good (so to each his own).Food is good not great but I always end up coming back because of their location.
Gq4Da9sNhXIGCvJ_g5T39g,3,"Five Star View. 

You would think Tampa has an abundance of places to eat and stare at water...you would think.   

It isn't easy, and that is why Whiskey Joe's is on my list of best sunset spots in Tampa. If you can't make it over to the beach, then WJ's back deck will do the trick.  

You can't see the sunset from Bahama Breeze or Landry's, and in fact it is limited from Crabby Bill's.  But at Whiskey Joe's it is unlimited. 

I particularly liked the lost and found sunglasses available for those dining outside, but as far as food, I wouldn't stray too far from the fish tacos (decent) and gator bites (good)."
bxuq329cCheUWsDySDznoQ,1,"Food was disgusting. Service was super slow. bartenders outside are incompetent, rude, and be prepared to wait 30 mins for a can of beer. Too bad cause the scenery was nice, but I am NOT referring to the bar staff!"
X0lR8anVhT5KMJ-dqYQVEA,3,Food was good. Exactly the quality you'd expect from a waterside tourist type place. Prices were higher than comparable restaurants.
kwFM7V5PVdPo_QcImYkygg,1,"Dirty beach bar, while the live music ever wasn't bad, the bar manager has little care about the customers he offends and the prices are above where they should be. The only great thing about this place was the view and you can get that from any of the other places close by like Bahama Breeze for example!"
IA3zOP-LawtzeWCZY1qlwA,1,"I experienced a very upsetting situation. My family and I arrived at Whiskey Joe's and placed our name on the list to sit outside. We were told we would have no wait as there was no one on the list to sit outside. My family and I waited 30 minutes patiently while a few tables remained empty and uncleaned. After witnessing 3 other families seated outside before us, even after we were told that there was no wait and that we were the only ones waiting, we decided to leave. Though the servers and hostess were aware that we were waiting and that I had checked in to confirm we were still waiting for a table outside, they still sat people outside who had just arrived, before us. As we were walking out the hostess said she was just going to seat us and rather than apologize for our long wait we received a sarcastic bye. 

I had previously rated Whiskey Joe's a 3, because it is a neat place to see the sunset while sipping on a drink. My new review is based on the poor level of service I and my family received. My family was visiting from out of state and I wanted to share a gorgeous Florida sunset with them and rather was seriously embarrassed by the service received."
0m9RPLRJRKElcZIc6OJgJQ,3,"Whiskey Joe's was okay. The view was very nice. The food was not so great. I got the cheeseburger sliders. They were okay, but overpriced. The cornbread was burnt at the bottom. The service was slow. Granted they were busy, but it could have been quicker. If you're just going for drinks and a nice view, this place would be great. However, if you want great food, then this is not the place to go."
_j7cKgGufLVp1WiKG3SMbg,4,"Gator bites good. Had recommended scallops, rice, and shrimp. Food good but missing some spices. Service friendly and pleadant."
VcOKMktGi6RSq9qRBFikcQ,4,"Our initial impression wasn't very good at the barefoot bar but as soon as we went to the restaurant and were helped by Brittany, our entire experience changed. She is an awesome waitress and was super nice and helpful to us. Will go back just because of her service"
t_U7gp4AT9R3u4g6eZhl6A,1,"Bar smells like mildew. We walked in bartender said hi and walked off, never asked if she could help us, seemed annoyed that we were there. This place is gross for real, bar counters are sticky.  Alright great talk."
d3UTcNtb4P_Zk_eNhZkjcA,1,So disappointed .   Jumbo shrimp was so small; not as described on menu.  Parking was valet only $5 when we arrived
v_Gd3WrYFxOSz6oUXj8TXQ,3,You get what you see. No surprises there. Standard beach bar and sub standard bar food. Good for a beer @
jvjGaqG4NtWjoWrjz63LJA,2,"Service slow, food blah, restaurant in need of refresh.  Great view of bay, but that is about it.  

Better choices all around.  Pass on this place."
ZUBmpD_bBIBWscUVwrcgHA,1,"This was the worst place I went to they have also no food you have a limit on the table! Valet was horrible they scratch up my 10,000 dollar rim! I would NEVER EVER COME BACK!!!!"
yVc5eX-p3XErRtXFFHO_PA,1,"Okay as we walk in, I asked if the food was fresh ""like no frozen shit, box - bag clam chowder  "" she said all was fresh... mmmm NO. THE DRINKS WOW the bartender needs to get back into cocktail school. This person couldn't mix a freaking rum and coke. The waiter forgot our starter appetizers witch is good,  because the FOOD WAS ALL FUCKED UP. WE had the grouper sandwich, and me and my wife are people who know what fresh grouper taste and looks like. BUT WHAT pissed me off the most wast the freaking drinks 40$ in 4 cocktails. . NEVER AGAIN. ."
2-RPBERIsmkUemIF7MH5ww,3,I wanted to like this restaurant. Cool location. I disagree with reviewers about the weak drinks. I had two very berry mojitos today and they were quite strong. Very yummy. I had the slow roasted pork tacos. They were just ok. My friend got the shrimp salad with key lime dressing. She thought the crab meat was imitation crabmeat and it was loaded with mayo. She barely touched it. Just picked out the shrimp and she's not picky at all.  Stick to the basics here and you'll be happy.
#NAME?,2,"Fish and Chips were good.  
Atmosphere was lacking.  Hostesses were really nice, server no so much!"
3Riv_0qreNhgZQEkmxBTGg,4,"The fancy fruity drinks we had were made with fresh mango and they were delicious, but it was hard to taste any alcohol in them.  We had peel 'n eat shrimp which were great.  I had a salad which was good and my friend had scallops on a skewer which she said were very good.

The view is the thing about this place.  Right on the water with amazing access to the sunset!  The atmosphere is great too.  The service is friendly and laid back.  The music's not too loud and people of all ages are in attendance.  Loved spending a few hours there."
cx35SIHmOVaRGNjP46o34Q,3,Average at best. Service outside was slow and I don't think our server was into working that day. Food was only so-so and I wouldn't necessarily come back for that.
ZgNNT7tS6oAuzajtPbHGYg,4,"I'm going 4-1/2 here ! Was really good atmosphere outside and food was great. The pork tacos were amazing. The burgers are great, rice and beans were legit and the wings were good. Beer selection could be a little better but the Cadillac (Jacks) Margarita is on point ! I reserve my 5 ratings for the elite but this place was close. First vacation in Florida and this was our first stop for lunch after getting off the plane ."
x8AyKN03GYuUrEHWhI_fvQ,3,"Good spot and location for a dinner for local and tourists.  Stopped by for dinner after work and it was a good spot.  Unfortunately it was raining so you really couldn't get a good view of the bay but you can tell it's a nice spot when the weather is nice.

I had gator nuggets as my appetizer and they're great.  Jambalaya was my entree and it was not too spicy and just right.  The wings my coworkers had was on steroids and their desserts were huge.  The server was good and very attentive.  Good music played in the background which made it that much more fun.

If I'm back this way I'd hit it again."
qRTXSF_kR1If0YUAOFQfEw,3,"Not too shabby of a place. Went out with a group of friends here last night and food was good. Restaurant has a great view and is right on the water. I ordered the Gator Bites (yum!) and the Seafood Mac 'n Cheese. Tasted okay, nothing to write home about. I'd deffo bring out of town visitors here for a unique place for dinner."
KnUs-jXZHAXCFC8Xy-_4Dw,1,Had lunch at the bar on a Thur around 3:00pm.  The staff was very friendly and courteous but the bar area was filthy.  There were fruit flies everywhere which I can get around but then I noticed the crud on the side of beer taps and on front of drawer.  Won't visit here again.  Food was only OK.
qbv2tM-V9KuKX7a3DPUwNQ,4,"I was in town for work and wanted to eat somewhere with a water view. I was pleasantly surprised by the view, even though we missed sunset. The staff was friendly and the food was great! I had the firecracker shrimp tacos and they were the perfect portion. They could have been a little spicier, but I ate them all, so they couldn't have been bad! 

Lilly was our waitress and she was excellent! Very friendly and took great care of us! 

Great place to see the water and beach!"
eXbDQQLMYLLcFcUaUt4jWw,1,"Driving by the place, I was looking for a nice meal with terrific view and atmosphere. Parking lot crowded, restaurant and bar empty. WTH??... Anyway...The sticky table and dirty silverware suggested that we should try and order something simple. We ordered nachos and shrimp. First bite on the nachos made me want to try the shrimps. Tried one... well.. I will try the nachos again.
Both simply uneatable. The tortilla tasted kind of bitter, burned, fired in an old oil... I gave up.
My wife ate some shrimps, I don't know how. We comlpained about the nachos, which we barely touched, the waitress said.""Im sorry""..and that's is. No discount, nothing. Left the place hungry. $40 down the drain. It was a LONG time since I had such a BAD meal. Amazing. I should not have paid."
W4ukVXyw_MEQ98DgcBhgNA,3,"Only three stars but food was delicious...the reason for the three stars is because we called ahead to ask if they had any steak available on the menu we were told yes, if the answer would have no we would have ate elsewhere...so forward to the restuarant we arrive to an empty lobby area no one at the desk, several staff members walk by without acknowledging were there finally we do get seated and order appettizers and when we attempt to order steak we are told there is no steak...okay wierd guess we'll do burgers...the appettizers arrive and actual appettizer gator bites are far overwhelmed with basketfilling lettuce, but however small the portion it was well prepared the burgers though were pretty fantastic, but they weren't steak..."
y0Z1q6l2NZsoRhfMP_M5jw,4,"Love the location, definitely a beach bar atmosphere.  Service was great.  The seating inside at the large bar area and seating outside in the deck is nice.  There's a separate restaurant area for more of a dining atmosphere.  It would definitely be a frequent stop if it wasn't quite so far away for us.

But what really inspired this review is that they have the best con queso I've ever had.  It's definitely not just cheese and salsa.  We ordered it with taco meat which comes on the side.  The portion was very large.  It's definitely something you should try."
ohv8xQLPkTj_JX5exULPIw,4,"Loved this place!! Just didn't like that I couldn't change my sides. I ordered salmon and wanted broccoli instead of fries but that wasn't an option. However, the view was awesome and the bar on the beach with fire pits was super fun! :)"
D0YiBUFX9RGgjn7i4nvPnw,3,"The walk in experience was not good.  We sat at the bar waiting for our table.  It took 15 mins for someone to acknowledge us, no one was smiling behind the bar it was horrible.  They ran out of bar glasses and were serving beers in water glasses, the cocktail glasses were very dirty.  The only experience that made the night was our awesome waitress Natasha she took great care of us and worked with the backed up bar and kitchen!  The food was good and came out in a timely manner.  Being locals we may not frequent here as much after this experience."
1qxxSw0721fhImRJfYyHVA,3,Let me start the review by saying I've never eaten here. But it's a good place to come and hang out by the water and have drinks with friends. Lots of room and it's almost always hop'n. Live music most weekends.
GtoG_zdJLP-KQP3uBvFQsg,2,"I would love to tell you how the food was but sat at a table outside on the beach for an hour...no exaggeration, and was never approached. Beer was cold. Bartenders were quick to serve. Only reason I gave them 2 stars. Great atmosphere. Good music. I'll be back but definately sitting at the bar not on a beach table."
k0BIdEUH3hVQscQ6ZOVRBQ,3,"Hers:
Food was average at best, view was nice. Nothing that special, although the drunk people around us seemed to be having a blast. Difficult parking because it was packed on a weekend afternoon in March.

His:
I've been here multiple times during different times of the year and the view is always the same. Location is nice, food is average at best. The best thing this place has going for it is location and closeness to the water. If you're looking for a casual waterfront drink for a decent price this is it. If you're looking for a place to eat with above average standards, look elsewhere."
cC4rFtmSKwo-jgYktiyEew,2,"Went for dinner Saturday pm- valet said lot was full either and to  park in beach lot or drive down to ""event parking"" and take shuttle back.  We found a spot at beach- parked, paid and went into restaurant. Checked with hostesses  at front-  they could not tell us whether we'd get locked in lot at 9 pm or not as (signage stated at beach)-- so ended up moving our car and taking shuttle after all.  Confusing and annoying.  Food was ok-  waitress was great.  I gave it 2 stars because we enjoyed our friends company and sitting on the outside patio."
c5G5w9XrUe_vWsisoqC9Yg,1,"Worst service ever! Cool idea, done badly. Skip the insanity of parking, the over-marketing and find another place. Unless, that is, you want to wait for over an hour to get a burger. Not worth your time."
QsHlZZoMf6pWIGuwtnZGsA,2,"Except the view of the TAMPA Bay and the fast service, this place is horrible. With jet ski rides right there and the unbelievable amount of noise they generate, you can even hear yourself. You feel like you want to just finish up and leave just so the noise stops!! Worst than this was the extremely greasy fried food. They were drenched in extremely unhealthy looking frying oil that kids couldn't even finish them. This place is only good for having drinks on deck after sunset (jet skis go away!) and nothing else. No food! Two stars is for the view, not for the restaurant!"
4jx5nWr-AqCvlCy3aGzt0Q,4,"Great location , good food , great presentation , good crowd & overall good place to hangout specially around sunset !!"
#NAME?,2,"Got some major beef with this popsicle stand. DO NOT GO AT LOW TIDE (unless ur in to that). When my homies walked into the tiki bar area, they got hosed by some dude pretending to be a bouncer who charged them each a bogus $5 cover. Food is overpriced and there was some trash Kennedy Chesney cover band playing the same three songs all night. I kindly asked the dude to play some 80's Joel and he flipped me off. WTF?!? Other that that, beach volleyball was great! Except for these two kids kept starting beef with my team. They were only like 6yo but they were talkin some of the heaviest heat I've felt in years. 
Tampa is weird place and this place surely screams Tampa. 
GO BUCKS!!!"
pQsD_sOON_7CpdqjKOP9Dg,1,"Looks like a fun place, but is definitely a tourist trap with all the products for sale as soon as you walk into the restaurant. We found the wings to be pretty awesome but nothing else that we ordered. Overall the food is less than mediocre and over-priced. We went on a Sunday evening for a simple dinner on the water.  We ordered the spicy Thai chicken wings for our appetizer along with a draft beer and a frozen strawberry margarita (which came in a daiquiri glass, huh?) The wings were really good and cooked right. We were happy. I ordered the fish tacos and my husband ordered a cheeseburger. The fish tacos were pretty much tasteless, the ""sauce"" added nothing to the tacos. The cheeseburger which my husband ordered medium, came RAW in the middle. We politely sent it back, but no apologies from the waitress. Needless to say, I was finished with all I was going to eat of the tacos before the cheeseburger came back, this time cooked correctly. We had a food bill of about $65 for about $12 of good food. BTW they charge $12 for the margarita. I don't get why places like this, that have the potential to be great, just don't care about quality, therefore, lose out on return business and recommendations."
pUJGpvMmAKv--18XxWTF4A,1,"Music overhaul of the worst kind.     They changed their music to only 80's rock - soooooo dated!!!!!     They went from having a tropical, caribbean vibe to making me feel like I should be wearing acid jeans with the holes up the sides.     SUCH A DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!"
L4c7bJt3ol_ZS04BmHaNcQ,1,"We were in Tampa for a few days, and thought this place looked like fun. When we arrived we were put off by the fact that there was ONLY valet parking. The valet was rude and condescending. We decided to stay anyway and put our name in for a table. We went to the bar while we were waiting for our table, and it took 10 to 15 minutes for anyone to acknowledge our presence. I felt sorry for the staff, because the place was unorganized and tables outside were too close together. Not a fun place in my opinion."
N81JjRoINYuTAxrM9CSyvg,5,"We had fabulous service from Lindsey! My mother came into town to visit from Wisconsin and spread my grandpas ashes in the ocean for Father's Day. Lindsey brightened our day during a very hard time! She provided excellent service. Lindsey went way above and beyond the call of duty. On top of her amazing table side manor the long islands were great and the garlic mussels were so tasty! Thank you so much Lindsey for helping us celebrate my papas life instead of mourning. We will be back for the great service, drinks and awesome food!"
mr3HWzr_2_TlfVzpyrDcow,5,"Whole experience was great!

Started with the valet which is only $5 and very friendly and professional, totally worth it.

Service inside was quick and friendly.  Food came out quickly and was delicious.

For the cost you can't beat the view!"
aJRoGa2ynzUdTtUfjyTm4Q,3,We had such a great waiter! He was so attentive and personable. The food was pretty good as well and they had a nice beer selection. We enjoyed sitting on the deck on the water on a beautiful Sunday afternoon. I really appreciate that dogs are allowed. My dog loved it as well!
C-39Z5JD7uMYHIjKehWg7g,1,"I was on the wait list when I asked to use bathroom, I was directed to tiki bar outdoor bars bathroom( one in restaurant was being repaired), tiki bathroom was a sani can with no service or lights, used my cell phone flashlight and uninal was clogged and toilet was overfilled, there were no sinks or sanitizer, I alerted my party to conditions and everybody wanted to leave, where does male staff clean up and use bathroom, it was upsetting to think they would try to operate without facilities, I heard others complain also."
4DIBkGVv-7AeR_KYXtffbw,4,"We lived here for two years and did not go because of some of the reviews.  Finally went because we had our college age daughter and her friend and I though the location would be fun regardless of the food.  Well the food was GREAT.  We got four different types of tacos, all fresh, great tasting.  We got the calamari which was excellent.  We will go back.  My assumption was that it was a college, sand, beer, type place.  No, it was nice, clean (sorry other reviewer the bathrooms were super clean when I was there) and all ages of people there.  Great for the whole family."
Aivru4-cmtdjjkL1_lJohg,5,This place blew my mind!!! The outside of the restaurant is beautiful and there are families and people enjoying the sun and beautiful water right on the side of the building. We sat right outside it was a beautiful day and our waiter was pretty busy but awesome he handled everything with speed and grace. His name escapes me at the moment which I am sorry for because he definitely deserves some type of recognition. Everything we ordered was delicious and came out piping hot!!! Every time I'm in the area I will be stopping by!!
ThiNl_7wDyxyqmqwRk_aBg,1,"Low quality people work here 
Sleezy rules: bilk for valet where u wait in a long long line of cars because you have more seats than you should for the state of your parking lot and cover then have too many people so have smelly ports potties. All the tables taken. Any way general boo and hiss. 

Consequently low quality clientele on the noisy beach."
Z-H_1CkXlQ4H9-AIAYe5hw,1,"Recommend finding another location if you are looking to eat food.  If drinking only, it might be okay.  Service was non-existent.  Had to walk up to the bar 3 separate times for a server to come take our order even though tables around us were being waited on.  No apologies or explanation.  Hostess gave us Full menus.  Only found out at time of order that our menus don't apply to our area."
T-zmDJGjIUWqM4_XPyVKAg,4,"Love this place, always an easy and relaxing time. Food is always good. I've never sat inside but honestly who wants to do that!! I had the Cobb salad minus the blue cheese dressing. Amazing."
ez7rDOb0TViM4CYh5lflvQ,3,"1st stop on a recent visit to Tampa - lunch at Whiskey Joe's.  It was a weekday, so we had our pick of tables.  The weather was cool for Feb, but the sun was shining so we took a table on the deck over the water.  Dining on the water is one of life's little pleasures, but when seagulls are dive-bombing your table every 8 minutes or so, the experience leaves something to be desired.  Work on one of those fishing-wire-canopies, Whiskey Joe's!

The food was good.  My chopped salad was light and tasty.  The po' boys were huge.  And the fries had great seasoning (at least what we could eat before the birds got to them).  If you're ordering beers with your meal, the pitchers are a good deal.  They're actually mini-pitchers, but they fill up three pint glasses and cost less than three drafts, so you come out ahead.

The bar area was pretty big and they had lots of games on the TVs.  Couple that with the free peanuts they offer, and I'll bet this is a good place to kick back when a game is on."
YstA9z1zcnTK681axFKk2Q,1,"Great view, mediocre food, and probably the worst service I've ever experienced. And I don't say that lightly. We finally came to the conclusion that our waitress was high, or at least drunk, because she was completely incompetent. We had to ask for everything- drinks, forks, refills- at least twice, and we were already laughing about how terrible the service was when she finally brought the food- or at least most of it. I sat there for a few minutes at least before she had to be reminded of a) what I ordered and b) that she'd forgotten to put in the order. My very mediocre burger finally arrived as all my companions were finishing. She  did not even offer to comp any part of the meal, and we sat there quite a while longer while she struggled to figure out how to split a bill evenly. Very disappointing, and despite the incredible location, I will not be back."
awlYFUdAC7C9pN4uk-KjIg,2,"Oh Whiskey Joes, you could have it all, but you need to expand your kitchen or staff. The view is amazing, the drinks are great, the food is good, the service, I'm sorry, is below average. 

If you're hungry, you're better off sitting outside where you'll get slightly faster service. If you're sitting inside, expect an hour wait for even an appetizer, 30 minutes for a bar drink. 

The view is great - you're right on the water with a man made beach overlooking Tampa bay. I've seen birds diving for fish, dolphins swimming in the bay, and a beautiful sunset or two. The beach bar is big, with a stage featuring live music later in the week. 

Most of my friends rave about the ""beer cheese soup."" My favorite entree is the fish tacos. My father likes to consider himself a ""keylime pie"" connoisseur, and he's given them a 5 star review on key lime pie. 

If you want half of the experience they could offer, I would eat outside."
pzhU_hCS0zJPUo_3jNW7nA,4,Great location with awesome views and friendly staff! We had a signature special whitefish that was delicious with good happy hour specials at the bar. I would definitely stop again on my way to/from the airport.
3qLDZC1q5GcBi7sG9pUpgQ,5,Perfect sunset spot great! Great food and service. Best wings we ever had! Will definitely come back and highly recommend. Parking is a bit of a pain the place was packed but we got lucky.
d3MhPbKNG7nZDElFcQidxw,4,"This place is very cool because it is on a decent beach, although not huge, and you can pull your boat up and onto the sand and drop anchor. Jump out of the boat, grab some lawn chairs and sit in the water or on the beach and take in the warm sun rays. 

The drinks were okay and priced about as expected. Live bands on certain nights and lots of nice scenery while having a cold drink make this a neat place to visit. 

The deep water area was not very clearly marked during our boat trip, so we had to rely on technology to make sure we didn't run aground while pulling up to the beach. 

there were jet ski rentals across the way and lots of people out relaxing and having a good time here and in the area."
tpNKSFIV-6rTLe_m7QHExw,4,Stayed at hotel near airport looking for a place on the water with outside bar and great food. The wings are huge and the gator bites are a must try.Friendly staff and great beer specials.
95x7HBxhAT-2EdvBKqozbQ,5,"For my friend's birthday, he wanted to find a good place for raw oysters. We were recommended different places from people in the Lion's Den, a cigar bar in Ybor City. After many fails, too crowded, no parking, etc, we found Whiskey Joe! Parking was difficult but we found one. Whiskey Joe is located on a beautiful beachfront area. The views from the restaurant were spectacular. We sat at the bar and ordered shrimp and raw oysters. We were beyond satisfied. The raw oysters were succulent. My friend loved the shrimp so much that he ordered a second plate. Our waitress was good but she was not able to keep up with all the demands she got when it got busy. Everything was so tasty and beautiful that it didn't matter. We ended the day walking on the beach and seeing the sunset."
QHI3-lnfAmUaW9EwZSfaaw,1,"It's a shame that a restaurant so beautifully located and perfectly set up could be ran so poorly. The service is absolutely horrible!!!! The bartenders at the tiki bar have no customer service skills what so ever. They are rude and lazy. We waited for 20 minutes to get drinks while the 4 bartenders that were behind the bar stood and chatted with each other ignoring customers. One bartender walked past and I said excuse me me and she said ""what's up"" and kept walking. Than we went upstairs to have dinner in the restaurant and the service was just as bad if not worse. The waitress didn't greet the table for at least 10 minutes. Than she never came back to check on us once our food was delivered. We had no condiments for our burgers. Our orders were not correct but we ate anyways because we were so hungry. Management was no where to be seen. I'm not even sure if there was a manager on duty. Needless to say this place needs a lot of changes."
CIuyIZHsMXIZQq8OnxWb4g,5,"Great view. Great food. 
Fun place to eat. 
Good local Grouper.
I really like this place. 
When I get back into town I will be back."
iCyj385s1_WZpHnMKP-Zyg,1,"I wish I could give this place negative stars. The set up of the establishment is OK, outdated and TOO laid back. I know they are trying to go for the laid back look, but it almost looks DIRTY. My friend and I sat at the bar and the bar was disgusting. From the looks of it, it looked like they hadn't bothered to even wipe down the bar in two days. The cups in which our drinks were poured in also, looked cheap. Another observation I made is that there aren't enough chairs for the bar, but there's a lot of space for more additional chairs=more customers. 

**SERVICE**

I really NEVER complain about service anywhere I go. It doesn't take much to please me,-- sometimes there are legitimate reasons behind the slow service etc. But this time... no excuse. The absolute worst I've ever experienced. There were two female bartenders behind the bar. A blonde and a brunette. The blonde was friendly. The brunette(who might have been pregnant... no just fat) with the tattoo on her lower back was beyond rude. For starters, she was disrespectful and told my friend that the dog wasn't allowed at their establishment, until she figured out the dog was a service dog.She could have approached the situation in a friendlier way.  As if that wasn't bad enough, she took a look at my ID and asked me if I had another form of ID with my name on it because the ID ""didn't look like me"". This was the FIRST time I've ever been told this and I have been to enough restaurants/bars. What a complete and utter moron.  In addition to questioning my legitimate ID she was very impolite towards us.I don't live in Tampa, but I really urge everyone to STAY AWAY from this place.  Maybe get rid some of your incompetent employees who walk around doing nothing, chatting with each other and hire some new ones who actually want to deliver A+ service!"
BvNkmFCYeTe3RFTgDGAAWA,2,"Terrible service at 2:00pm on a Wed. 
Took forever to get our drinks...
Ordered crabcakes as an appetizer, server never put in the order...
Brought one entree, because the others weren't ready????
Never checked back to see how the food was probably because she was embarrassed.
I don't know if I'll return, which is sad because it's such a great location..."
hzP60IKxu8dM4LVsl08fJA,4,"We had a nice time here.  It was a beautiful day & the deck area is a great place for the view of the bay.  The grouper sandwich is delish and my salmon was tasty.  The service is good, just sit under the awning.  Beware of birds.  Definitely a place to go back to for a relaxed, chill day."
uPaA2OutltcWEfBPha2t8g,4,We had dinner outside on the deck- awesome view! The waitress was really attentive and our drinks and food were delivered pretty quickly. The drink selection was awesome- they had a pretty good tequila menu.
vq0VHJ-PE2m9JnAbNupyNQ,4,"If you're looking for a place to have a beachside cocktail and grub then this is it. Their burgers, chips, and queso will not disappoint. Pair that with a cold corona dressed and your good to go. Im giving them 4 stars because the food isn't as stellar as the beach view and drink selection. Also, our food took a while to come out during a non-peak hour of the day."
4ubvz3G8DGWAgHLfNmPqdw,1,"Pretty awful experience.
The only good thing was the location and as far as the food we had the Salad was good.
Things went wrong from the beginning.
We had a reservation for lunch. When we tried to check in, they told us there are no tables available outside,  but if we want we could eat at the beach bar that's part of the place.   We go down the beach and they literally insist on searching our bags.  They refuse entry to the beach because I had a can of water in my bag which you can't leave in your car in the tampa heat.  So we go back to the desk where there are 4, yes 4 people standing at the desk and 1 person checking in.   We had to wait 5 minutes  to be helped... I guess 3 of the people including the manager are just for decoration.   Then they couldn't find the reservation anymore.. other things went wrong...  too bad, we had really wanted to like the place."
eU35vwusbSoNesfe-SW2Eg,5,Nice place. Great atmosphere and nice staff. I had the shrimp and sausage quesadilla and tried the alligator bites. Both were amazing!
6-UuxOn4pitDieQ604W3iA,2,"Went to the beach part of the restaurant and our server took 30 minutes to approach us. After dropping of menus, she never came back. We went to the bar to order food and the bartender seemed upset that we only ordered food and no drinks. Food was quick to arrive, but was not very good (my fish tacos were very dry as well as my friend's burger). It was a fun atmosphere due to the beach and DJ, but the service left much to be desired. Will most likely not be returning."
Vt5EGKVpaRO2RNg_eOfKUQ,1,"This was my first time at Whiskey Joes. I was initially impressed with the interior and our waitress was friendly so we started off on a good note. Shortly after sitting down I noticed that a different server's butt cheeks were literally hanging out of her shorts. At this point our appetites were quickly fading. Then comes the food. A coworker and I both got the tacos. Midway through the first taco, my coworker found a curly short black hair sticking out. I then checked my tacos and there it was, a short black hair hanging out in my tortilla. The manager came over to ask what happened and then proceeded to ask my coworker where the hair was as if she didn't believe her. I then said that I had a picture and she asked why I would take a picture lol. Good thing I did. They did take the tacos off of the bill and offered a different meal at no cost. However, I still would suggest that you do not go to Whiskey Joe's."
iIP7GIE7N-TNcfs8GsIc5Q,1,"I had such a horrible experience. I was so excited to check this place out since they have one down here in Miami as well. I was with a group of 5 people and we were very hungry and expecting to sit outside with a nice view. We arrived at the front and they told us they weren't sitting outside anymore (even though it wasn't raining and they weren't closing anytime soon) and when we asked the host if we can go down to the section by the sand she said ""whatever"". We decided to sit by the sand because there was no wait time, but the service was horrible. There was a gentleman with a bandana and a white tank top kinda shirt, and he advised our party that if we wanted to eat we had to order from the bar because they were cutting servers. I went up to the bar where I found a security guard who told me if I wanted food to order with a server. I approached a server and when the gentleman with the bandana saw me, he approached me to tell me that he already told our party what and where we had to go to order food. I advised him I was told something different at the bar and he began to get loud with me. 

If I had to order food at the bar, I had no problem with it. There's no need to be rude, or to approach someone questioning them. I have / had no reason to lie, I just wanted food. I think the service was horrible, and server said he didn't want to serve our table because he was ""leaving soon"". We were there for a couple hours and he was still working, so I don't know what he meant. 

Needless to say, never going again."
oibOA1uSJFHljju-q7daag,5,This by far is the best place I have eaten EVER!!!!  The grilled shrimp is is amazing words can not explain how good. We also ordered the coconut mahi bites and were blow away! I am stuffed and still want more! They also have great draft beer and friendly staff! I wish I could give this more than 5 stars!!  We will definitely make this a stop on every visit we make to Tampa!!
0tSKgMX1bRwZ6KhCYBexPg,2,"Would not recommend. We ordered Skinny Margaritas, queso and fish tacos. The queso and tacos came out at the same time. So much for an appetizer. And the drinks didn't come until we were almost done with our meal. We asked about the delay and the waitress said the bar was backed up, but the restaurant was only half full. When we finally got our drinks they were not the ""skinny"" versions we were expecting and they were so bad, my sister decided not to even drink hers. The view is nice but not worth the trip."
sPFxOeiqscKwWdZ1m_JbYQ,5,"When you first arrive you have to leave your car at the valet parking (which is free, only had to tip the guys). We were a party of 5 (3 adults, 2 children), went for lunch around 1pm on a Thursday and the place wasn't crowded at all. We were seated immediately and our table had a lovely view of the bay. The attention was excellent (I don't recall the name of the waiter but he was an older man, very kind and attentive, the fifth star is totally for him). Our food came in about ten minutes, and word of advice: the plates are huge. We had two houses favorites: the Joe's Islas Carnitas and the Swashbuckler's basket, both great, even though they weren't exactly healthy. The kids menu was very good too, and it comes with dessert and a kid's drink. R price/food is good in my opinion. 
After eating we went to the beach and their barefoot bar. The staff is really nice, there is fresh water to wash up after a bath in the bay water and restrooms. If you don't mind the seaweed is a really great beach. The kids loved it. There are shadow seats and chairs for those who want to take some sun. It really is a place for everyone, and you only have to pay for what you consume. 
We didn't stay long enough for the sunset and evening shows, but that's only a reason for returning!"
NUMBlsccBdvdaez-mtbDLA,3,Food was barely okay. Grouper sandwich was a baby-baby grouper sandwich and slightly undercooked. Fries are good-but at the prices you clearly understand you're  here for the view and experience.  It's a Pretty cool place with music and a sometimes a band or DJ!  And beachside dining on this side of tampa bay is awesome for a quick day out.
ZIsp6ilzdAsY-i3qtI2Ijg,2,"We saw this restaurant across the way from our bay front Best Western hotel and decided, based on the Jamaican music and the fire pits on the beach that we had to check it out.

 Started out with ""Joe's Pile of Nachos"".  They offered to do the extra toppings on the side, which was perfect since my fiance doesn't know what's good and doesn't like sour cream or guacamole.  They were good and plentiful, really probably too big of an appetizer for two.  

My fiance got their signature 1/2 pound burger and I got the signature salad since I was so full from the nachos. We also both imbibed on their hurricane cocktails, which at $8 each was a little pricey.

Our server was friendly and willing to offer recommendations, telling us what she liked only at the end of the night to confess that she'd actually never eaten there and asked if she'd been convincing.  I was a little taken aback.  And it kind of put a sour note to our dinner.  

What this restaurant has going for it is its location. I've had better food and service."
fBdsrvaRl6dWJZ308OAGTg,1,"Just be careful with the Valet staff, I had just taken my phone out of my Lifeproof case to charge it and put it up on the dash. 
Halfway home realized it wasnt where I put it, tore the car apart this morning and it is gone."
TwUn2nRgV7ZYWO0G80E9-w,1,"Ehhh. Sorry guys. The majority of food here is pretty awful.

Sure. It is in a beautiful location. Nice beach bar with a view of the water and a water-side bar. The place is packed on weekends. They have their margaritas and seafood. 

The place is mostly inhabited my a past-middle-aged crowd, which I guess have horrible taste buds  since most of their generation has been eating food out of cans which was all the rage in their youth and most of their adult years. The food is severely overpriced for the taste. 

They do give a portion of their earnings to the Big Cat Rescue in Tampa, which is cool. 

The best part of my experience in this restaurant was my server Allison, which was peppy, fun, and attentive."
Z9PF581BZA9Emga76hWjmA,2,"Got some major beef with this popsicle stand. DO NOT GO AT LOW TIDE (unless ur in to that). When my homies walked into the tiki bar area, they got hosed by some dude pretending to be a bouncer who charged them each a bogus $5 cover. Food is overpriced and there was some trash Kennedy Chesney cover band playing the same three songs all night. I kindly asked the wannabe Mr. Chesney to play some 80's Joel and he flipped me off. WTF?!? Other that that, beach volleyball was great! Except for these two kids kept starting beef with my team. They were only like 6yo but they were talkin some of the heaviest heat I've felt in years. 
Tampa is weird place and this place surely screams Tampa."
JPi8nRShce_8YjxBVAAEEg,2,Location is amazing off the beach. Great view from the table out to the water. If it wasn't due to the location I don't think this place would still be in business anywhere else. Went with a big crowd of 12 ppl. There was a long wait for the table. I was so disappointed to wait so long for bland food. Had 3 shrimp tacos which tasted like frozen shrimp from the grocery store. I only ate one. Didn't like anything anyone else ordered.  I won't be back.
qSwjUgKaolFhK-74PiiWqw,4,"Whiskey Joe's is my go-to place for lazy Sunday afternoons. Their location is like having 3 places in one: the beach bar down below, the indoor restaurant and bar, and outdoor deck on the west side. 

I like to go up on the deck and have a few beers and maybe an appetizer while waiting for the sunset, which can be pretty spectacular. The beer is always cold and service at the bar has been good in my experience."
jEsulYYCkxjIYEr9YzUWyw,3,"Came here for a graduation dinner-they reserved a huge table for myself and about 8 other loud New Jersey natives.

Decent priced drinks & food. Nothing spectacular about the food tho. The crab and artichoke dip was basically all i had--which was good but obviously not so fresh. Also, vegetarians beware--BACON is in everything. I wanted to try the beer soup so bad..but bacon. i was told by the waitress the clam chowder was free of bacon--nope not true. watch out!

really nice view, the outdoor beach looks awesome! really cool concept!

Valet parking but i believe you gotta pay."
gffjnJq8K3yxUBQX4eviww,4,"I visited Whiskey Joe's this past weekend with a group of people ranging in ages from 25 to 85 and everyone had a great time.  We thoroughly enjoyed the view from the beach area.  The option to have both the indoor and outdoor bars suited the needs for everyone in our group.  We ate dinner under a tent, the shrimp tacos I ordered were average, the shrimp had a good flavor but the other fillings weren't anything special.  If you like extra cheesy pizza give their pizza a try! The atmosphere can't be beat for a fun time in the sun!"
N7pmP7frtedsXXr6pK9YYw,1,The girls at the bar have there h ads up there asses. I sat for 15 min and know one even said anything to me at the bar. Then I waited 45 min for my food and when I got it was cold. I literally would never recommend this fucking overpriced bar and grill to my worst enemy. They never even asked me if I needed anything and literally people were clearing there own tables and bringing there plates to the bar if they zero stars it would still be saying a lot for this place.
41suMTkz5JKenvs6xU5hjg,5,"Food is awesome.... Seafood Mac n cheese is AMAZING as well as the grouper.

Great outside seating right on the water :)

Wait staff is super nice and attentive. Our waitress Rachel was great loved her!!!

Only negative is host staff seemed young and like they had no clue what they were doing... And her shorts were so short I may have seen hooha"
G0yV8bS7ILFFymR47aspNg,4,It's a good simple place. They have free valet parking and friendly hosts. There is a patio over the bay that nice but not great. The food and menu were decent but a bit dull.
eEBJLOGPHb1nqFRxH2gMiA,2,"Great place to doc your boat or hangout on the beach or by the water but food is not so great unless looking for maybe burgers and fries or chips and dip. We went hoping for fresh seafood on the water and not a very good assortment on the menu for that.  Customer service was a little off too. Everyone was very nice but our app took forever and we barely saw our waitress. 

We ended up going over the bridge to Joe's Crab Shack in search of seafood!!!! :)"
8KhXUg-oK5_t95fdPyC0iA,5,Right on the water.  If you sit at the bar you can eat with your toes in the sand.  Fish tacos have large amount of fish and are tasty.

scgU7mCdenOSlZV5X4vpfw,4,"We went here because we were in the area and had a coupon for a free appetizer. The view is absolutely gorgeous!! The place was relatively empty when I went (probably because it was at 1pm on a Monday afternoon) but that was fine with me. We had couple of drinks and tried the  sauage and shrimp quesadillas. Everything was delicious. The servers were friendly (even though I had to ask the server for water like 3x before I actually got it). The only draw back here is that they are kinda pricey. The entrees were $20 +/- each. Yikes! Before the discount was applied, the two drinks and one appetizer were $34. May or may not go back, depends on whether or not I come into a chunk of money to splurge. :0)"
e8jp-VgVKhiFWTuahn8Elg,3,"We needed a place for a group of 12 with a variety of meal budgets and Whisky Joe's meet the bill. Would I take a date to this place to impress her? Nope. I would guess this is a place populated mainly by tourists.  You can view the menu and make reservations on line. There is mandatory valet parking. 

The setting is ideal, most tables will have an expansive view of the bay. However, the place is very tried and in need of an update to carpet and furniture which I'm sure won't come until there are new owners. We had a reservation so waiting was not as issue. But on the Sunday night we went, there were many tables available. In one word, this place is hugh!!

We were greeted quickly by our high energy waitress who answered our questions competently, if not a bit bluntly. The menu was somewhat limited but daily specials add to the variety. We ordered appetizers which included fried calamai, nachos, and queso and chips. All appetizer portions are plentiful and can be shared amongst two or three people. The calamri strips were large and meaty but few amongst the peppers and onions with which they are served. The queso was just a notch about velveta. The nachos had to be sent back for guacamole which had been left off. The problem was attended to and quickly remedied.

The fish boards, specials of the day were variable. I choose the swordfish and this was a mistake. The fish was thinly sliced and this made it impossible to cook properly. I ordered grilled and had I been doing the grilling, this piece of fish would have been done in 1 minute flat. Others at the table had snapper which was judged to be better. You also select a sauce and a topping for the fish. Mine was chipotle mayo which was thick, but tasty.

Other entre's ordered included the Yuengling beer can chicken which is a whole, small hen marinated and roasted on a can of, you guessed it, Yuengling beer. The chicken was moist and flavorful. The fish and chips and seafood gumbo and fish taco's were given thumbs up. We did not order deserts.

Despite the size of the party, no automatic gratuity was added and our waitress was accommodating of a request for separate checks.

All in all, everyone liked the place. It was exactly what we needed given the budgets. Dress is Florida casual which mean just about anything goes.
